Caspian Sea
The Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland
body of water, variously classed as the world's
largest lake or a full-ﬂedged sea. It is an
endorheic basin (a basin without outﬂows)
located between Europe and Asia, to the east of
the Caucasus Mountains and to the west of the
broad steppe of Central Asia. The sea has a
surface area of 371,000 km2 (143,200 sq mi)
(excluding
the
detached
lagoon
of
Garabogazköl) and a volume of 78,200 km3
(18,800 cu mi). It has a salinity of approximately
1.2% (12 g/l), about a third of the salinity of
most seawater. It is bounded by Kazakhstan to
the northeast, Russia to the northwest,
Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and
Turkmenistan to the southeast. The Caspian Sea
is home to a wide range of species and may be
best known for its caviar and oil industries.
Pollution from the oil industry and dams on
rivers draining into the Caspian Sea have had
negative eﬀects on the organisms living in the
sea.
The wide and endorheic Caspian Sea has a
north–south orientation and its main freshwater
inﬂow, the Volga River, enters at the shallow
north end. Two deep basins occupy its central
and southern areas. These lead to horizontal
diﬀerences in temperature, salinity, and ecology.
The Caspian Sea spreads out over nearly 1,200
kilometres (750 mi) from north to south, with an
average width of 320 km (200 mi). It covers a
region of around 386,400 km2 (149,200 sq mi)
and its surface is about 27 m (89 ft) below sea
level. The sea bed in the southern part reaches
as low as 1,023 m (3,356 ft) below sea level,
which is the second lowest natural depression
on Earth after Lake Baikal (−1,180 m or
−3,870 ft). The ancient inhabitants of its coast
perceived the Caspian Sea as an ocean,
probably because of its saltiness and large size.

Etymology
The word Caspian is derived from the name of the Caspi, an ancient people who lived
to the southwest of the sea in Transcaucasia.[2] Strabo wrote that "to the country of
the Albanians belongs also the territory called Caspiane, which was named after the
Caspian tribe, as was also the sea; but the tribe has now disappeared".[3] Moreover,
the Caspian Gates, which is the name of a region in Iran's Tehran province, possibly

indicates that they migrated to the south of the sea. The Iranian city of Qazvin shares
the root of its name with that of the sea. In fact, the traditional Arabic name for the
sea itself is Baḥr Qazwin (Sea of Qazvin).[4]
In classical antiquity among Greeks and Persians it was called the Hyrcanian
Ocean.[5] In Persian middle age, as well as in modern Iran, it is known as ‫درﻳﺎى ﺧﺰر‬,
Daryā-e Khazar, which was named after Khazars an ancient nomadic tribe in the
region. it is also sometimes referred to as Mazandaran Sea (Persian: ‫ )درﯾﺎی ﻣﺎزﻧﺪران‬in
Iran.[6]
Some Turkic peoples refer to the lake as Khazar Sea. In Turkmen, the name is Hazar
deňizi, in Azeri, it is Xəzər dənizi, and in modern Turkish, it is Hazar denizi. In all
these cases, the second word simply means "sea", and the ﬁrst word refers to the
historical Khazars who had a large empire based to the north of the Caspian Sea
between the 7th and 10th centuries. Some other Turkic ethnic groups refer to the
lake as Caspian Sea. In Kazakh, where it is called Каспий теңізі, Kaspiy teñizi, in
Kyrgyz: Каспий деңизи (Kaspiy deñizi), in Uzbek: Kaspiy dengizi.
Renaissance European maps labelled it as Abbacuch Sea (Oronce Fine's 1531 world
map), Mar de Bachu (Ortellius' 1570 map), or Mar de Sala (Mercator's 1569 map).
Old Russian sources call it the Khvalyn or Khvalis Sea (Хвалынское море /
Хвалисское море) after the name of Khwarezmia.[7] In modern Russian, it is called
Каспи́ йское мо́ ре, Kaspiyskoye more.

Physical characteristics
Formation
The Caspian Sea, like the Black Sea, is a remnant of the ancient Paratethys Sea. Its
seaﬂoor is, therefore, a standard oceanic basalt and not a continental granite body. It
became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to tectonic uplift and a fall in sea
level. During warm and dry climatic periods, the landlocked sea almost dried up,
depositing evaporitic sediments like halite that were covered by wind-blown deposits
and were sealed oﬀ as an evaporite sink when cool, wet climates reﬁlled the basin.
(Comparable evaporite beds underlie the Mediterranean.) Due to the current inﬂow
of fresh water in the north, the Caspian Sea water is almost fresh in its northern
portions, getting more brackish toward the south. It is most saline on the Iranian
shore, where the catchment basin contributes little ﬂow.[8] Currently, the mean
salinity of the Caspian is one third that of Earth's oceans. The Garabogazköl
embayment, which dried up when water ﬂow from the main body of the Caspian was
blocked in the 1980s but has since been restored, routinely exceeds oceanic salinity
by a factor of 10.[9]

Geography
The Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of water in the world and accounts for 40
to 44% of the total lacustrine waters of the world.[10] The coastlines of the Caspian
are shared by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. The Caspian
is divided into three distinct physical regions: the Northern, Middle, and Southern

Caspian.[11] The Northern–Middle boundary is the
Mangyshlak Threshold, which runs through Chechen
Island and Cape Tiub-Karagan. The Middle–Southern
boundary is the Apsheron Threshold, a sill of tectonic
origin between the Eurasian continent and an oceanic
remnant,[12] that runs through Zhiloi Island and Cape
Kuuli.[13] The Garabogazköl Bay is the saline eastern
inlet of the Caspian, which is part of Turkmenistan
and at times has been a lake in its own right due to
the isthmus that cuts it oﬀ from the Caspian.
Area around the Caspian Sea.
Yellow area indicates the
(approximate) drainage area.

Diﬀerences between the three regions are dramatic.
The Northern Caspian only includes the Caspian
shelf,[14] and is very shallow; it accounts for less than
1% of the total water volume with an average depth
of only 5–6 metres (16–20 ft). The sea noticeably drops oﬀ towards the Middle
Caspian, where the average depth is 190 metres (620 ft).[13] The Southern Caspian is
the deepest, with oceanic depths of over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), greatly exceeding
the depth of other regional seas, such as the Persian Gulf. The Middle and Southern
Caspian account for 33% and 66% of the total water volume, respectively.[11] The
northern portion of the Caspian Sea typically freezes in the winter, and in the coldest
winters ice forms in the south as well.[15]
Over 130 rivers provide inﬂow to the Caspian, with the Volga River being the largest.
A second aﬄuent, the Ural River, ﬂows in from the north, and the Kura River ﬂows
into the sea from the west. In the past, the Amu Darya (Oxus) of Central Asia in the
east often changed course to empty into the Caspian through a now-desiccated
riverbed called the Uzboy River, as did the Syr Darya farther north. The Caspian also
has several small islands; they are primarily located in the north and have a
collective land area of roughly 2,000 km2 (770 sq mi). Adjacent to the North Caspian
is the Caspian Depression, a low-lying region 27 metres (89 ft) below sea level. The
Central Asian steppes stretch across the northeast coast, while the Caucasus
mountains hug the western shore. The biomes to both the north and east are
characterized by cold, continental deserts. Conversely, the climate to the southwest
and south are generally warm with uneven elevation due to a mix of highlands and
mountain ranges; the drastic changes in climate alongside the Caspian have led to a
great deal of biodiversity in the region.[9]
The Caspian Sea has numerous islands throughout, all of them near the coasts; none
in the deeper parts of the sea. Ogurja Ada is the largest island. The island is 37 km
(23 mi) long, with gazelles roaming freely on it. In the North Caspian, the majority of
the islands are small and uninhabited, like the Tyuleniy Archipelago, an Important
Bird Area (IBA), although some of them have human settlements.

Hydrology
The Caspian has characteristics common to both seas and lakes. It is often listed as
the world's largest lake, although it is not a freshwater lake. It contains about 3.5
times more water, by volume, than all ﬁve of North America's Great Lakes combined.
The Caspian was once part of the Tethys Ocean, but became landlocked about 5.5
million years ago due to plate tectonics.[10] The Volga River (about 80% of the inﬂow)

and the Ural River discharge into the Caspian Sea,
but it has no natural outﬂow other than by
evaporation. Thus the Caspian ecosystem is a closed
basin, with its own sea level history that is
independent of the eustatic level of the world's
oceans.
The level of the Caspian has fallen and risen, often
rapidly, many times over the centuries. Some Russian
Caspian Sea near Aktau,
historians claim that a medieval rising of the Caspian,
Mangystau Region, Kazakhstan
perhaps caused by the Amu Darya changing its inﬂow
to the Caspian from the 13th century to the 16th
century, caused the coastal towns of Khazaria, such
as Atil, to ﬂood. In 2004, the water level was 28 metres (92 feet) below sea level.
Over the centuries, Caspian Sea levels have changed in synchrony with the
estimated discharge of the Volga, which in turn depends on rainfall levels in its vast
catchment basin. Precipitation is related to variations in the amount of North
Atlantic depressions that reach the interior, and they in turn are aﬀected by cycles of
the North Atlantic oscillation. Thus levels in the Caspian Sea relate to atmospheric
conditions in the North Atlantic, thousands of kilometres to the northwest.
The last short-term sea-level cycle started with a sea-level fall of 3 m (10 ft) from
1929 to 1977, followed by a rise of 3 m (10 ft) from 1977 until 1995. Since then
smaller oscillations have taken place.[16]
A study by the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences estimated that the level of the sea
was dropping by more than six centimetres per year due to increased evaporation
due to rising temperatures caused by climate change.[17]

Environmental degradation
The Volga River, the largest in Europe, drains 20% of the European land area and is
the source of 80% of the Caspian's inﬂow. Its lower reaches are heavily developed
with numerous unregulated releases of chemical and biological pollutants. The UN
Environment Programme warns that the Caspian "suﬀers from an enormous burden
of pollution from oil extraction and reﬁning, oﬀshore oil ﬁelds, radioactive wastes
from nuclear power plants and huge volumes of untreated sewage and industrial
waste introduced mainly by the Volga River".[17]
The magnitude of fossil fuel extraction and transport activity in the Caspian also
poses a risk to the environment. The island of Vulf oﬀ Baku, for example, has
suﬀered ecological damage as a result of the petrochemical industry; this has
signiﬁcantly decreased the number of species of marine birds in the area. Existing
and planned oil and gas pipelines under the sea further increase the potential threat
to the environment.[18]

Nature
Aquatic

Flora
The rising level of the Caspian Sea between 1994 and
1996 reduced the number of habitats for rare species
of aquatic vegetation. This has been attributed to a
general lack of seeding material in newly formed
coastal lagoons and water bodies.
Fauna
The Caspian turtle (Mauremys caspica), although
found in neighboring areas, is a wholly freshwater
species. The zebra mussel is native to the Caspian
and Black Sea basins, but has become an invasive
species elsewhere, when introduced. The area has
given its name to several species, including the
Caspian gull and the Caspian tern. The Caspian seal
(Pusa caspica) is the only aquatic mammal and is
endemic to the Caspian Sea, being one of very few
seal species that live in inland waters, but it is
diﬀerent from the those inhabiting freshwaters due to
the hydrological environment of the sea. A century
ago the Caspian was home to more than one million
seals. Today, fewer than 10% remain.[17]

and what may be a whaling scene indicates large baleen whales[24] likely
being present in Caspian Sea at least until when the Caspian Sea ceased being a part
of the ocean system or until the Quaternary or much more recent periods such as
until the last glacial period or antiquity.[25] Although the rock art on Kichikdash
Mountain is assumed to be of a dolphin[26] or of a beaked whale,[23] it might instead
represent the famous beluga sturgeon due to its size (430 cm in length), but fossil
records suggest certain ancestors of modern dolphins and whales, such as
Macrokentriodon morani (bottlenose dolphins) and Balaenoptera sibbaldina (blue
whales) were presumably larger than their present descendants. From the same
artworks, auks, like Brunnich's Guillemot could also have been in the sea as well,
and these petroglyphs suggest marine inﬂow between the current Caspian Sea and
the Arctic Ocean or North Sea, or the Black Sea.[26] This is supported by the
existences of current endemic, oceanic species such as lagoon cockles which was
genetically identiﬁed to originate in Caspian/Black Seas regions.[24]
The sea's basin (including associated waters such as rivers) has 160 native species
and subspecies of ﬁsh in more than 60 genera.[19] About 62% of the species and
subspecies are endemic, as are 4–6 genera (depending on taxonomic treatment). The
lake proper has 115 natives, including 73 endemics (63.5%).[19] Among the more
than 50 genera in the lake proper, 3–4 are endemic: Anatirostrum, Caspiomyzon,
Chasar (often included in Ponticola) and Hyrcanogobius.[19] By far the most
numerous families in the lake proper are gobies (35 species and subspecies),
cyprinids (32) and clupeids (22). Two particularly rich genera are Alosa with 18

endemic species/subspecies and Benthophilus with 16 endemic species.[19] Other
examples of endemics are four species of Clupeonella, Gobio volgensis, two Rutilus,
three Sabanejewia, Stenodus leucichthys, two Salmo, two Mesogobius and three
Neogobius.[19] Most non-endemic natives are either shared with the Black Sea basin
or widespread Palearctic species such as crucian carp, Prussian carp, common carp,
common bream, common bleak, asp, white bream, sunbleak, common dace, common
roach, common rudd, European chub, sichel, tench, European weatherﬁsh, wels
catﬁsh, northern pike, burbot, European perch and zander.[19] Almost 30 nonindigenous, introduced ﬁsh species have been reported from the Caspian Sea, but
only a few have become established.[19]
Six sturgeon species, the Russian, bastard, Persian, sterlet, starry and beluga, are
native to the Caspian Sea.[19] The last of these is arguably the largest freshwater ﬁsh
in the world. The sturgeon yield roe (eggs) that are processed into caviar.
Overﬁshing has depleted a number of the historic ﬁsheries.[27] In recent years,
overﬁshing has threatened the sturgeon population to the point that
environmentalists advocate banning sturgeon ﬁshing completely until the population
recovers. The high price of sturgeon caviar—more than 1,500 Azerbaijani manats[17]
(US$880 as of April 2019) per kilo—allows ﬁshermen to aﬀord bribes to ensure the
authorities look the other way, making regulations in many locations ineﬀective.[28]
Caviar harvesting further endangers the ﬁsh stocks, since it targets reproductive
females.

Terrestrial
Flora
Many rare and endemic plant species of Russia are associated with the tidal areas of
the Volga delta and riparian forests of the Samur River delta. The shoreline is also a
unique refuge for plants adapted to the loose sands of the Central Asian Deserts. The
principal limiting factors to successful establishment of plant species are
hydrological imbalances within the surrounding deltas, water pollution, and various
land reclamation activities. The water level change within the Caspian Sea is an
indirect reason for which plants may not get established.
These aﬀect aquatic plants of the Volga Delta, such as Aldrovanda vesiculosa and the
native Nelumbo caspica. About 11 plant species are found in the Samur River Delta,
including the unique liana forests that date back to the Tertiary period.
Fauna
Reptiles native to the region include spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca buxtoni)
and Horsﬁeld's tortoise.
The Asiatic cheetah used to occur in the Trans-Caucasus and Central Asia, but is
today restricted to Iran.[29][30]
The Asiatic lion used to occur in the Trans-Caucasus, Iran, and possibly the
southern part of Turkestan.[29][30]
The Caspian tiger used to occur in northern Iran, the Caucasus and Central
Asia.[29][30]

The Persian leopard is found in Iran, the Caucasus
and Central Asia.[29][30]

History
The history of the Caspian sea is divided into two
parts: a Miocene stage, determined by tectonic events
that correlate with the closing of the Tethys Sea, and
a Pleistocene stage, that includes glaciation cycles
Illustration of two Caspian
and the creation of the present Volga River. During
tigers, extinct in the region
the ﬁrst stage, the Tethys Sea had evolved into the
since the 1970s.
Sarmatian Lake, that was created from the modern
Black Sea and south Caspian, when the collision of
the Arabian peninsula with Western Asia pushed up the
Kopet Dag and Caucasus Mountains, setting deﬁnitive south
and west boundaries to the Caspian basin. This orogeneic
movement was continuous throughout the years, while
Caspian was regularly disconnecting from the Black Sea. In
the late Pontian, a mountain arch rose across the south
basin and divided it in the Khachmaz and Lankaran Lakes
(or early Balaxani). The period of restriction to the south
basin was reversed during the Akchagylian, when the lake
expanded to more than three times its present area and
established the ﬁrst of a series of contacts with the Black
Sea and with Lake Aral. A recession of the Lake Akchagyl
completed stage one.[31]
The earliest hominid remains found around the Caspian Sea
are from Dmanisi dating back to around 1.8 Ma and yielded
a number of skeletal remains of Homo erectus or Homo
ergaster. More later evidence for human occupation of the
region came from a number of caves in Georgia and
Azerbaijan such as Kudaro
and Azykh Caves. There is

Caspian Sea (Bahr ulKhazar). 10th century
map by Ibn Hawqal

The Caspian area is rich in energy resources. Oil wells were being dug in the region
as early as the 10th century to reach oil "for use in everyday life, both for medicinal
purposes and for heating and lighting in homes".[34] By the 16th century, Europeans
were aware of the rich oil and gas deposits around the area. English traders Thomas
Bannister and Jeﬀrey Duckett described the area around Baku as "a strange thing to
behold, for there issueth out of the ground a marvelous quantity of oil, which serveth
all the country to burn in their houses. This oil is black and is called nefte. There is
also by the town of Baku, another kind of oil which is white and very precious [i.e.,
petroleum]."[35]
Greeks also called it Hyrcanian/Hyrkanian Sea (Ancient Greek: Υρκανία θάλαττα[36]
and Υρκανία θάλασσα[37]).
In the 18th century, during the rule of Peter I the Great, Fedor I. Soimonov,
hydrographer and pioneering explorer of the Caspian Sea charted the until then little
known body of water. Soimonov drew a set of four maps and wrote Pilot of the
Caspian Sea, the ﬁrst report and modern maps of the Caspian, that were published
in 1720 by the Russian Academy of Sciences.[38]
Today, oil and gas platforms abound along the edges of the sea.[39]

Economy
Countries on the Caspian region, such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan,
illustrate the examples of natural-resource-based economies. A resource-based
economy is deﬁned as one where the natural resources, oil and gas, compose more
than 10 percent of the particular country's GDP and 40 percent of exports.[40] All the
Caspian region economies are highly dependent on the mineral wealth. The world
energy markets were inﬂuenced by Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, as they became
strategically crucial in this sphere, thus attracting the largest share of FDI (foreign
direct investment).
Iran has an enormous energy potential based on several speciﬁc factors. It has
reserves containing 137.5 billion bbl of crude oil, the second largest in the world,
producing around four million bbl/day. Additionally, Iran has an estimated 988.4

trillion cubic feet of natural gas, around 16 percent of
total world reserves, which makes it to play a key role
in the global energy security equation.[41]
Russia's economy ranks as the twelfth largest by
nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power
parity in 2015.[42] Russia's extensive mineral and
energy resources are the largest such reserves in the
world,[43] making it the second leading producer of oil
and natural gas globally.[44]
Caspian littoral states join eﬀorts to develop
infrastructure, tourism and trade in the region. The
ﬁrst Caspian Economic Forum was convened on
Oil pipelines in the Caspian
region. September 2002
August 12, 2019 in Turkmenistan and brought
together representatives of Kazakhstan, Russia,
Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkmenistan. The forum
included several meetings of Caspian littoral countries’ ministers of economy and
transport ministers.[45]

Oil and gas
The Caspian Sea region presently is a signiﬁcant, but
not major, supplier of crude oil to world markets,
based upon estimates by BP Amoco and the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, U.S. Department
of Energy. The Caspian region produced an estimated
1.4–1.5 million barrels per day (bbls/day) including
natural gas liquids in 2001, or 1.9% of total world
output (table 1).3 More than a dozen non-Caspian
countries each produce more than 1.5 million
bbls/day. Caspian region production has been higher,
but suﬀered during the collapse of the Soviet Union
and the years following. Kazakhstan accounts for 55%
and Azerbaijan for about 20% of current regional oil
output.[46]

The world's ﬁrst oﬀshore wells and machine-drilled wells were made in Bibi-Heybat
Bay, near Baku, Azerbaijan. In 1873, exploration and development of oil began in
some of the largest ﬁelds known to exist in the world at that time on the Absheron
Peninsula near the villages of Balakhanli, Sabunchi, Ramana, and Bibi Heybat. Total
recoverable reserves were more than 500 million tons. By 1900, Baku had more than
3,000 oil wells, 2,000 of which were producing at industrial levels. By the end of the
19th century, Baku became known as the "black gold capital", and many skilled
workers and specialists ﬂocked to the city.
By the beginning of the 20th century, Baku was the centre of international oil
industry. In 1920, when the Bolsheviks captured Azerbaijan, all private property –
including oil wells and factories – was conﬁscated. Afterwards, the republic's entire
oil industry came under the control of the Soviet Union. By 1941, Azerbaijan was
producing a record 23.5 million tons of oil per year, and the Baku region supplied
nearly 72 percent of all oil extracted in the entire Soviet Union.[34]

In 1994, the "Contract of the Century" was signed,
signalling
the
start
of
major
international
development of the Baku oil ﬁelds. The Baku–Tbilisi–
Ceyhan pipeline, a major pipeline allowing Azerbaijan
oil to ﬂow straight to the Turkish Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan, opened in 2006.
The Vladimir Filanovsky ﬁeld in the Russian section of
the body of water was discovered for its wealth of oil
in 2005. It is reportedly the largest discovery of oil in
25 years. It was announced in October 2016 that
Lukoil would start production in this region.[47]
Transport

Baku, which is the starting point of all sea routes of
Azerbaijan, is the largest port of the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan has access to the
oceans along the Caspian Sea-Volga-Volga-Don Canal, and the Don-Sea of Azov.
Along with the Volga-Don Canal, the Azerbaijani vessels have the opportunity to
enter the world ocean through the Volga-Baltic and White Sea-Baltic canals.
Moreover, oil tankers are being transported through the Caspian Sea. Baku Sea
Trade Port and Caspian Shipping Company CJSC, have a big role in the sea
transportation of Azerbaijan. The Caspian Sea Shipping Company CJSC, along with
the transport ﬂeet, also includes a specialized ﬂeet and shipyards. The transport ﬂeet
consists of 51 vessels, including 20 tankers, 13 ferries, 15 universal dry cargo
vessels, 2 Ro-Ro vessels, as well as 1 technical vessel and 1 ﬂoating workshop. The
specialized ﬂeet includes 210 vessels, including 20 cranes, 25 towing and supplying
vehicles, 26 passenger, two pipe-laying, six ﬁre-ﬁghting, seven engineeringgeological, two diving and 88 auxiliary vessels.[48]
The Caspian Sea Shipping Company of Azerbaijan, which acts as a liaison in the
Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA), simultaneously with the
transportation of cargo and passengers in the Trans-Caspian direction, also performs
work to fully ensure the processes of oil and gas production at sea. This activity has
a rich history. The development of the shipping industry in Azerbaijan is closely
connected with the formation and progress of the oil industry. In the 19th century,
the sharp increase in oil production in Baku gave a huge impetus to the development
of shipping in the Caspian Sea, and as a result, there was a need to create
fundamentally new ﬂoating facilities for the transportation of oil and oil products.[49]

Political issues
Many of the islands along the Azerbaijani coast continue to hold signiﬁcant
geopolitical and economic importance because of the potential oil reserves found
nearby. Bulla Island, Pirallahı Island, and Nargin, which is still used as a former
Soviet base and is the largest island in the Baku bay, all hold oil reserves.
The collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent opening of the region has led to an
intense investment and development scramble by international oil companies. In
1998, Dick Cheney commented that "I can't think of a time when we've had a region
emerge as suddenly to become as strategically signiﬁcant as the Caspian."[50]

A key problem to further development in the region is the status of the Caspian Sea
and the establishment of the water boundaries among the ﬁve littoral states. The
current disputes along Azerbaijan's maritime borders with Turkmenistan and Iran
could potentially aﬀect future development plans.
Much controversy currently exists over the proposed Trans-Caspian oil and gas
pipelines. These projects would allow Western markets easier access to Kazakh oil
and, potentially, Uzbek and Turkmen gas as well. Russia oﬀicially opposes the project
on environmental grounds.[51] However, analysts note that the pipelines would
bypass Russia completely, thereby denying the country valuable transit fees, as well
as destroying its current monopoly on westward-bound hydrocarbon exports from
the region.[51] Recently, both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have expressed their
support for the Trans-Caspian Pipeline.[52]
U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks revealed that BP covered up a gas leak
and blowout incident in September 2008 at an operating gas ﬁeld in the AzeriChirag-Guneshi area of the Azerbaijan Caspian Sea.[53][54]

The Caspian Sea is the world's largest salt lake. Its length from north to south is
1,174 km, average width is 326 km, and total area is 375,000 km2. Water depth in
the middle of the Caspian Sea ranges up to 788 m and in the southern part, up to
1,025 m. It has no outlet, and although the surface level of water ﬂuctuates, it
averages about 25 m below sea level according to recent measurements. Total area
of the FSU portion of the Caspian Sea is 322,000 km2, including the shelf zone. To a
depth of 200 m, the area is 240,000 km2.[57]

Negotiations
As of 2000, negotiations related to the demarcation of the Caspian Sea had been
going on for nearly a decade among the states bordering the Caspian – Azerbaijan,
Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Iran. The status of the Caspian Sea[58] is the
key problem. Access to mineral resources (oil and natural gas), access for ﬁshing,
and access to international waters (through Russia's Volga river and the canals
connecting it to the Black Sea and Baltic Sea) all depend upon the outcomes of
negotiations. Access to the Volga River is particularly important for the landlocked
states of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. This concerns Russia, because
the potential traﬀic would use its inland waterways. If a body of water is labelled as a
sea, then there would be some precedents and international treaties obliging the
granting of access permits to foreign vessels. If a body of water is labelled merely as
a lake, then there are no such obligations. Environmental issues are also somewhat
connected to the status and borders issue.
All ﬁve Caspian littoral states maintain naval forces on the sea.[59]
According to a treaty signed between Iran and the Soviet Union, the Caspian Sea is
technically a lake and was divided into two sectors (Iranian and Soviet), but the
resources (then mainly ﬁsh) were commonly shared. The line between the two
sectors was considered an international border in a common lake, like Lake Albert.
The Soviet sector was sub-divided into the four littoral republics' administrative
sectors.
Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan have bilateral agreements with each other based
on median lines. Because of their use by the three nations, median lines seem to be
the most likely method of delineating territory in future agreements. However, Iran
insists on a single, multilateral agreement between the ﬁve nations (as this is the
only way for it to achieve a one-ﬁfth share of the sea). Azerbaijan is at odds with Iran
over some oil ﬁelds that both states claim. Occasionally, Iranian patrol boats have
ﬁred at vessels sent by Azerbaijan for exploration into the disputed region. There are
similar tensions between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (the latter claims that the
former has pumped more oil than agreed from a ﬁeld, recognized by both parties as
shared).
The Caspian littoral states' meeting in 2007 signed an agreement that bars any ship
not ﬂying the national ﬂag of a littoral state from entering the sea.[60]
Negotiations among the ﬁve littoral states have been ongoing, amidst ebbs and
ﬂows, for the past 20 years, with some degree of progress being made at the fourth
Caspian Summit held in Astrakhan in 2014.[61]

Caspian Summit
The Caspian Summit is a head of state-level meeting of the ﬁve littoral states.[62] The
ﬁfth Caspian Summit took place on August 12, 2018 in the Kazakh port city of Aktau
.[62] The ﬁve leaders signed the ‘Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian
Sea’.[63]
Representatives of the Caspian littoral states held a meeting in the capital of
Kazakhstan on September 28, 2018 as a follow-up to the Aktau Summit. The
conference was hosted by the Kazakh Ministry of Investment and Development. The
participants in the meeting agreed to host an investment forum for the Caspian
region every two years.[64]

Convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea
The ﬁve littoral states build consensus on legally binding governance of the Caspian
Sea through Special Working Groups of a Convention on the Legal Status of the
Caspian Sea.[65] In advance of a Caspian Summit, 51st Special Working Group took
place in Astana in May 2018 and found consensus on multiple agreements:
Agreements on cooperation in the ﬁeld of transport; trade and economic
cooperation; prevention of incidents on the sea; combating terrorism; ﬁghting
against organized crime; and border security cooperation.[66]
The convention grants jurisdiction over 24 km (15 mi) of territorial waters to each
neighboring country, plus an additional 16 km (10 mi) of exclusive ﬁshing rights on
the surface, while the rest is international waters. The seabed, on the other hand,
remains undeﬁned, subject to bilateral agreements between countries. Thus, the
Caspian Sea is legally neither fully a sea nor a lake.[67]
While the convention addresses caviar production, oil and gas extraction, and
military uses, it does not touch on environmental issues.[17]

Crossborder inﬂow
UNECE recognizes several rivers that cross international borders which ﬂow into the
Caspian Sea.[68] These are:

Transportation

Although the Caspian Sea is endorheic, its main tributary, the Volga, is connected by
important shipping canals with the Don River (and thus the Black Sea) and with the
Baltic Sea, with branch canals to Northern Dvina and to the White Sea.
Another Caspian tributary, the Kuma River, is connected by an irrigation canal with
the Don basin as well.
Several scheduled ferry services (including train ferries) operate on the Caspian Sea,
including:
a line between Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan, (formerly Krasnovodsk) and Baku.
a ferry line between Baku and Aktau.
several ferry lines between cities in Iran and Russia.
The ferries are mostly used for cargo; only the Baku–Aktau and Baku–Türkmenbaşy
routes accept passengers.

Canals
As an endorheic basin, the Caspian Sea basin has no natural connection with the
ocean. Since the medieval period, traders reached the Caspian via a number of
portages that connected the Volga and its tributaries with the Don River (which ﬂows
into the Sea of Azov) and various rivers that ﬂow into the Baltic Sea. Primitive canals
connecting the Volga Basin with the Baltic were constructed as early as the early
18th century. Since then, a number of canal projects have been completed.
The two modern canal systems that connect the Volga Basin, and hence the Caspian
Sea, with the ocean are the Volga–Baltic Waterway and the Volga–Don Canal.
The proposed Pechora–Kama Canal was a project that was widely discussed between
the 1930s and 1980s. Shipping was a secondary consideration. Its main goal was to
redirect some of the water of the Pechora River (which ﬂows into the Arctic Ocean)
via the Kama River into the Volga. The goals were both irrigation and the
stabilization of the water level in the Caspian, which was thought to be falling
dangerously fast at the time. During 1971, some peaceful nuclear construction
experiments were carried out in the region by the U.S.S.R.
In June 2007, in order to boost his oil-rich country's access to markets, Kazakhstan's
President Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed a 700-kilometre (435-mile) link between
the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. It is hoped that the "Eurasia Canal" (Manych
Ship Canal) would transform landlocked Kazakhstan and other Central Asian
countries into maritime states, enabling them to signiﬁcantly increase trade volume.
Although the canal would traverse Russian territory, it would beneﬁt Kazakhstan
through its Caspian Sea ports. The most likely route for the canal, the oﬀicials at the
Committee on Water Resources at Kazakhstan's Agriculture Ministry say, would
follow the Kuma–Manych Depression, where currently a chain of rivers and lakes is
already connected by an irrigation canal (the Kuma–Manych Canal). Upgrading the
Volga–Don Canal would be another option.[69]
