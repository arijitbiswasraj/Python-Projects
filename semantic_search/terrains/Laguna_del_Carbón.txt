Laguna del Carbón
Laguna del Carbón (Spanish for "coal lagoon") is
a salt lake in Corpen Aike Department, Santa Cruz
Province, Argentina. This salt lake is located 54
kilometres (34 miles) from Puerto San Julián,
within the Gran Bajo de San Julián (Great San
Julián Depression), an endorheic basin situated
between the San Julian Bay and the Chico River. At
105 metres (344 ft) below sea level, Laguna del
Carbón is the lowest point of Argentina and both
the Western and Southern Hemispheres, and the
seventh-lowest point on Earth.[1]
