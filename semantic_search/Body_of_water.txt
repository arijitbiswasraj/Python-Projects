Body of water
A body of water or waterbody[1] (often spelled
water body) is any signiﬁcant accumulation of water,
generally on a planet's surface. The term most often
refers to oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes
smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or
more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have
to be still or contained; rivers, streams, canals, and
other geographical features where water moves from
one place to another are also considered bodies of
water.[2]
Most are naturally occurring geographical features,
but some are artiﬁcial. There are types that can
be either. For example, most reservoirs are
created by engineering dams, but some natural
lakes are used as reservoirs. Similarly, most
harbors are naturally occurring bays, but some
harbors have been created through construction.
Bodies of water that are navigable are known as
waterways. Some bodies of water collect and
move water, such as rivers and streams, and
others primarily hold water, such as lakes and
oceans.

The Aubach (Wiehl) in Germany
(Watercourse)

A fjord (Lysefjord) in Norway

The term body of water can also refer to a
reservoir of water held by a plant, technically known as a phytotelma.
Bodies of water are aﬀected by gravity which is what creates the tidal eﬀects on
Earth.[3]

Note that there are some geographical features
involving water that are not bodies of water, for
example waterfalls, geysers and rapids.
Arm of the sea – also sea arm, used to describe
a sea loch.

Harbor – an artiﬁcial or naturally occurring body of water where ships are stored or
may shelter from the ocean's weather and currents.
Impoundment – an artiﬁcially-created body of water, by damming a source. Often
used for ﬂood control, as a drinking water supply (reservoir), recreation,
ornamentation (artiﬁcial pond), or other purpose or combination of purposes. Note
that the process of creating an "impoundment" of water is itself called
"impoundment."
Inlet – a body of water, usually seawater, which has characteristics of one or more
of the following: bay, cove, estuary, ﬁrth, fjord, geo, sea loch, or sound.
