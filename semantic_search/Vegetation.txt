Vegetation
Vegetation is an assemblage of plant species and the
ground cover they provide.[2] It is a general term,
without speciﬁc reference to particular taxa, life
forms, structure, spatial extent, or any other speciﬁc
botanical or geographic characteristics. It is broader
than the term ﬂora which refers to species
composition. Perhaps the closest synonym is plant
community, but vegetation can, and often does, refer
to a wider range of spatial scales than that term does,
including scales as large as the global. Primeval
redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum
bogs, desert soil crusts, roadside weed patches,
wheat ﬁelds, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are
encompassed by the term vegetation.
The vegetation type is deﬁned by characteristic
dominant species, or a common aspect of the
assemblage, such as an elevation range or
environmental commonality.[3] The contemporary use
of vegetation approximates that of ecologist Frederic
Clements' term earth cover, an expression still used
by the Bureau of Land Management.

These maps show a vegetation
scale, or index of greenness,
based on several factors: the
number and type of plants,
leaﬁness, and plant health.
Where foliage is dense and
plants are growing quickly, the
index is high, represented in
dark green. Regions with sparse
vegetation and a low
vegetation index are shown in
tan. Based on measurements
from the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) on NASA's Terra
satellite. Areas where there is
no data are gray.[1]

The distinction between vegetation (the general appearance of a community) and
ﬂora (the taxonomic composition of a community) was ﬁrst made by Jules Thurmann
(1849). Prior to this, the two terms (vegetation and ﬂora) were used
indiscriminately,[4][5] and still are in some contexts. Augustin de Candolle (1820) also
made a similar distinction, but he used the terms "station" (habitat type) and
"habitation" (botanical region).[6][7] Later, the concept of vegetation would inﬂuence
the usage of the term biome, with the inclusion of the animal element.[8]
Other concepts similar to vegetation are "physiognomy of vegetation" (Humboldt,
1805, 1807) and "formation" (Grisebach, 1838, derived from "Vegetationsform",
Martius, 1824).[5][9][10][11][12]
Departing from Linnean taxonomy, Humboldt established a new science, dividing
plant geography between taxonomists who studied plants as taxa and geographers
who studied plants as vegetation.[13] The physiognomic approach in the study of
vegetation is common among biogeographers working on vegetation on a world
scale, or when there is a lack of taxonomic knowledge of someplace (e.g., in the
tropics, where biodiversity is commonly high).[14]
The concept of "vegetation type" is more ambiguous. The deﬁnition of a speciﬁc
vegetation type may include not only physiognomy but also ﬂoristic and habitat
aspects.[15][16] Furthermore, the phytosociological approach in the study of
vegetation relies upon a fundamental unit, the plant association, which is deﬁned
upon ﬂora.[17]
An inﬂuential, clear and simple classiﬁcation scheme for types of vegetation was
produced by Wagner & von Sydow (1888).[18][19] Other important works with a
physiognomic approach includes Grisebach (1872), Warming (1895, 1909), Schimper
(1898), Tansley and Chipp (1926), Rübel (1930), Burtt Davy (1938), Beard (1944,
1955), André Aubréville (1956, 1957), Trochain (1955, 1957), Küchler (1967),
Ellenberg and Mueller-Dombois (1967) (see vegetation classiﬁcation).

Classiﬁcations
There are many approaches for the classiﬁcation of vegetation (physiognomy, ﬂora,
ecology, etc.).[20][21][22][23] Much of the work on vegetation classiﬁcation comes from
European and North American ecologists, and they have fundamentally diﬀerent
approaches. In North America, vegetation types are based on a combination of the
following criteria: climate pattern, plant habit, phenology and/or growth form, and
dominant species. In the current US standard (adopted by the Federal Geographic
Data Committee (FGDC), and originally developed by UNESCO and The Nature
Conservancy), the classiﬁcation is hierarchical and incorporates the non-ﬂoristic
criteria into the upper (most general) ﬁve levels and limited ﬂoristic criteria only into
the lower (most speciﬁc) two levels. In Europe, classiﬁcation often relies much more
heavily, sometimes entirely, on ﬂoristic (species) composition alone, without explicit
reference to climate, phenology or growth forms. It often emphasizes indicator or
diagnostic species which may distinguish one classiﬁcation from another.
In the FGDC standard, the hierarchy levels, from most general to most speciﬁc, are:
system, class, subclass, group, formation, alliance, and association. The lowest level,
or association, is thus the most precisely deﬁned, and incorporates the names of the
dominant one to three (usually two) species of a type. An example of a vegetation

type deﬁned at the level of class
might be "Forest, canopy cover
> 60%"; at the level of a
formation
as
"Winter-rain,
broad-leaved,
evergreen,
sclerophyllous,
closed-canopy
forest"; at the level of alliance
as "Arbutus menziesii forest";
and at the level of association
as
"Arbutus
menziesiiLithocarpus dense ﬂora forest",
referring to Paciﬁc madronetanoak forests which occur in
California and Oregon, USA. In
practice, the levels of the
alliance and/or an association
are the most often used,
particularly
in
vegetation
mapping, just as the Latin
binomial is most often used in
discussing particular species in
taxonomy
and
in
general
communication.

Dynamics

Semi-desert

Like all the biological systems,
plant
communities
are
temporally
and
spatially
dynamic; they change at all
possible scales. Dynamism in
vegetation is deﬁned primarily
as
changes
in
species
composition and/or vegetation
structure.

Temporal dynamics
Temporally, a large number of processes or events
can cause change, but for sake of simplicity, they can
be categorized roughly as either abrupt or gradual.
Abrupt changes are generally referred to as
disturbances; these include things like wildﬁres, high
winds, landslides, ﬂoods, avalanches and the like.
Their causes are usually external (exogenous) to the
community—they are natural processes occurring
Vegetation types at the time of
(mostly) independently of the natural processes of the
Last Glacial Maximum
community (such as germination, growth, death, etc.).
Such events can change vegetation structure and
composition very quickly and for long time periods,
and they can do so over large areas. Very few ecosystems are without some type of

disturbance as a regular and recurring part of the long term system dynamic. Fire
and wind disturbances are particularly common throughout many vegetation types
worldwide. Fire is particularly potent because of its ability to destroy not only living
plants, but also the seeds, spores, and living meristems representing the potential
next generation, and because of ﬁre's impact on fauna populations, soil
characteristics and other ecosystem elements and processes (for further discussion
of this topic see ﬁre ecology).
Temporal change at a slower pace is ubiquitous; it comprises the ﬁeld of ecological
succession. Succession is the relatively gradual change in structure and taxonomic
composition that arises as the vegetation itself modiﬁes various environmental
variables over time, including light, water and nutrient levels. These modiﬁcations
change the suite of species most adapted to grow, survive and reproduce in an area,
causing ﬂoristic changes. These ﬂoristic changes contribute to structural changes
that are inherent in plant growth even in the absence of species changes (especially
where plants have a large maximum size, i.e. trees), causing slow and broadly
predictable changes in the vegetation. Succession can be interrupted at any time by
disturbance, setting the system either back to a previous state, or oﬀ on another
trajectory altogether. Because of this, successional processes may or may not lead to
some static, ﬁnal state. Moreover, accurately predicting the characteristics of such a
state, even if it does arise, is not always possible. In short, vegetative communities
are subject to many variables that together set limits on the predictability of future
conditions.

Spatial dynamics
As a general rule, the larger an area under consideration, the more likely the
vegetation will be heterogeneous across it. Two main factors are at work. First, the
temporal dynamics of disturbance and succession are increasingly unlikely to be in
synchrony across any area as the size of that area increases. That is, diﬀerent areas
will be at diﬀerent developmental stages due to diﬀerent local histories, particularly
their times since last major disturbance. This fact interacts with inherent
environmental variability (e.g. in soils, climate, topography, etc.), which is also a
function of area. Environmental variability constrains the suite of species that can
occupy a given area, and the two factors together interact to create a mosaic of
vegetation conditions across the landscape. Only in agricultural or horticultural
systems does vegetation ever approach perfect uniformity. In natural systems, there
is always heterogeneity, although its scale and intensity will vary widely..
