Tree
In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an
elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and
leaves in most species. In some usages, the deﬁnition
of a tree may be narrower, including only woody
plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable
as lumber or plants above a speciﬁed height. In wider
deﬁnitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and
bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic
group but include a variety of plant species that have
independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way
to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.
Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several
thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for
370 million years. It is estimated that there are some
three trillion mature trees in the world.[1]
A tree typically has many secondary branches
supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This
trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength,
and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part
of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded
by a layer of bark which serves as a protective
barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and
spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and
extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above
ground, the branches divide into smaller branches
and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which
capture light energy and convert it into sugars by
photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's
growth and development.

Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and
fruit may be present, but some trees, such as
conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones.
Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but
tree ferns produce spores instead.
Trees play a signiﬁcant role in reducing erosion and
European larch (Larix decidua),
moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide
a coniferous tree which is also
from the atmosphere and store large quantities of
deciduous
carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a
habitat for many species of animals and plants.
Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees
provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and
fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are
shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for

agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been
revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the
world's mythologies.

Deﬁnition
Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised
precise deﬁnition of what a tree is, either botanically or in common language.[2] In
its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of an elongated stem, or

trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or
branches at some distance above the ground.[3] Trees
are also typically deﬁned by height,[4] with smaller
plants from 0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called
shrubs,[5] so the minimum height of a tree is only
loosely deﬁned.[4] Large herbaceous plants such as
papaya and bananas are trees in this broad
sense.[2][6]
A commonly applied narrower deﬁnition is that a tree
has a woody trunk formed by secondary growth,
meaning that the trunk thickens each year by
growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards
growth from the growing tip.[4][7] Under such a

produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying cells formed by
primary growth.[11] Tree species in the genus
Dracaena, despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth caused by
meristem in their trunk, but it is diﬀerent from the thickening meristem found in
dicotyledonous trees.[12]
Aside from structural deﬁnitions, trees are commonly deﬁned by use; for instance, as
those plants which yield lumber.[13]

Overview
The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in diﬀerent groups of
plants: by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for sunlight.[14] Trees tend
to be tall and long-lived,[15] some reaching several thousand years old.[16] Several
trees are among the oldest organisms now living.[17] Trees have modiﬁed structures
such as thicker stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and
durability, allowing them to grow taller than many other plants and to spread out
their foliage. They diﬀer from shrubs, which have a similar growth form, by usually
growing larger and having a single main stem;[5] but there is no consistent
distinction between a tree and a shrub,[18] made more confusing by the fact that
trees may be reduced in size under harsher environmental conditions such as on
mountains and subarctic areas. The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated
classes of plants in response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic
example of parallel evolution. With an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the number
of trees worldwide might total twenty-ﬁve per cent of all living plant species.[19][20]
The greatest number of these grow in tropical regions and many of these areas have
not yet been fully surveyed by botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly
known.[21]

Tall herbaceous
monocotyledonous plants such
as banana lack secondary
growth, but are trees under the
broadest deﬁnition.

The majority of tree species are angiosperms. There
are about 1000 species of gymnosperm trees,[22]
including
conifers,
cycads,
ginkgophytes
and
gnetales; they produce seeds which are not enclosed
in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones,
and many have tough waxy leaves, such as pine
needles.[23] Most angiosperm trees are eudicots, the
"true dicotyledons", so named because the seeds
contain two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also
some trees among the old lineages of ﬂowering plants
called basal angiosperms or paleodicots; these
include
Amborella,
Magnolia,
nutmeg
and
[24]
avocado,
while trees such as bamboo, palms and
bananas are monocots.

Wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most
types of tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger. The vascular system of trees
allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and
without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees, as relatively tall
plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the
suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves. If insuﬀicient water is
available the leaves will die.[25] The three main parts of trees include the root, stem,
and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the
living cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium
allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this
growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium
that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork
cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of
wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.[26]
Trees are either evergreen, having foliage that persists and remains green
throughout the year,[27] or deciduous, shedding their leaves at the end of the
growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage.[28] Most conifers
are evergreens, but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their
needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and
Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis.[5] The
crown is the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves,[29] while the
uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the
canopy.[30] A sapling is a young tree.[31]
Many tall palms are herbaceous[32] monocots; these do not undergo secondary
growth and never produce wood.[9][10] In many tall palms, the terminal bud on the
main stem is the only one to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large
spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight
trunks, growing up to 20 metres (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of
rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.[33]

Distribution

The Daintree Rainforest

The number of trees in the world, according to a 2015
estimate, is 3.04 trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in
the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 trillion (20%) in the
temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the coniferous
boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher
than previous estimates, and is based on tree densities
measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a
wide margin of error, not least because the samples are
mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate
suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually
and about 5 billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since
the start of human agriculture, the number of trees
worldwide has decreased by 46%.[1][34][35][36]

In suitable environments, such as the Daintree Rainforest in
Queensland, or the mixed podocarp and broadleaf forest of
Ulva Island, New Zealand, forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax
community at the end of a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are
colonised by taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a
forest canopy.[37][38]
In
cool
temperate
regions,
conifers
often
predominate; a widely distributed climax community
in the far north of the northern hemisphere is moist
taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal
forest).[39][40] Taiga is the world's largest land biome,
forming 29% of the world's forest cover.[41] The long
cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant
growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short
summer season when the temperature rises and the
Conifers in the Swabian alps
days are long. Light is very limited under their dense
cover and there may be little plant life on the forest
ﬂoor, although fungi may abound.[42] Similar woodland is found on mountains where
the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of
the growing season.[43]
Where rainfall is relatively evenly spread across the seasons in temperate regions,
temperate broadleaf and mixed forest typiﬁed by species like oak, beech, birch and
maple is found.[44] Temperate forest is also found in the southern hemisphere, as for
example in the Eastern Australia temperate forest, characterised by Eucalyptus
forest and open acacia woodland.[45]
In tropical regions with a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier part of the
year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, diﬀerent species of
broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous.[46] In tropical
regions with a drier savanna climate and insuﬀicient rainfall to support dense
forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is
covered with grass and scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such
areas.[47]

Parts and function

Roots
The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground
and gather water and nutrients to transfer to all parts
of the tree. They are also used for reproduction,
defence, survival, energy storage and many other
purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the ﬁrst
part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the
process of germination. This develops into a taproot
which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks
lateral roots branch out of the side of this and grow
A young red pine (Pinus
horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In
resinosa) with spread of roots
most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and
visible, as a result of soil
the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of
erosion
the ﬁner roots are single cell root hairs. These are in
immediate contact with the soil particles and can
absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen
to respire and only a few species such as mangroves and the pond cypress (Taxodium
ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.[48]
In the soil, the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi. Many of these are known as
mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are speciﬁc
to a single tree species, which will not ﬂourish in the absence of its mycorrhizal
associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires
minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus, while the fungus obtains the
carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree.[49] The hyphae of the fungus
can link diﬀerent trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients and signals
from one place to another.[50] The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps
protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a
tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues.[51] Fossil
evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the
early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the ﬁrst vascular plants
colonised dry land.[52]

Buttress roots of the kapok tree
(Ceiba pentandra)

Some trees such as the alders (Alnus species) have a
symbiotic relationship with Frankia species, a
ﬁlamentous bacterium that can ﬁx nitrogen from the
air, converting it into ammonia. They have
actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the
bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in
low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be
unable to thrive.[53] The plant hormones called
cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process
closely related to mycorrhizal association.[54]

It has been demonstrated that some trees are
interconnected through their root system, forming a
colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural
grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are
performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then
checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.[55]

The roots are, generally, an underground part of the tree, but some tree species have
evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two
kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from
air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that
develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically
into the mud.[56] A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan.[57] Many
large trees have buttress roots which ﬂare out from the lower part of the trunk.
These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway
in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is
poor and the roots are close to the surface.[58]
Some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in order to get
oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of excess water. These root
extensions are called pneumatophores, and are present, among others, in black
mangrove and pond cypress.[56]

Trunk
The main purpose of the trunk is to raise the leaves above
the ground, enabling the tree to overtop other plants and
outcompete them for light.[59] It also transports water and
nutrients from the roots to the aerial parts of the tree, and
distributes the food produced by the leaves to all other
parts, including the roots.[60]
In the case of angiosperms and gymnosperms, the
outermost layer of the trunk is the bark, mostly composed
of dead cells of phellem (cork).[61] It provides a thick,
waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects
the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and

pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diﬀuses. Bark
autumn
is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the
cork cambium or phellogen.[61] The London plane (Platanus
× acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large ﬂakes.
Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels oﬀ in strips. As the tree's
girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers
develop ﬁssures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the
bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea
brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona
oﬀicinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable.[60] Large treelike plants with ligniﬁed trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and
Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have diﬀerent structures
and outer coverings.[62]
Although the bark functions as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring
insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew their
way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal
spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a
fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles.
The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking oﬀ the xylem tissue carrying

sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually
the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies.
In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were
killed by this disease.[63]

baccata) showing 27 annual
growth rings, pale sapwood and

The innermost layer of bark is known as the phloem
and this is involved in the transport of the sap
containing the sugars made by photosynthesis to
other parts of the tree. It is a soft spongy layer of
living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to
form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells
which provide padding and include ﬁbres for
strengthening the tissue.[64] Inside the phloem is a
layer of undiﬀerentiated cells one cell thick called the
vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually
dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and
wood cells known as xylem on the inside.[65]

The newly created xylem is the sapwood. It is
composed of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and
is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper
parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted
into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of
the heartwood are blocked in some species. Heartwood is usually darker in colour
than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three
quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, and most of the
remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or
a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood – tree
rings.[66] These rings are the annual growth rings[67][68] There may also be rays
running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin
sheets of living tissue permeating the wood.[66] Many older trees may become hollow
but may still stand upright for many years.[69]

Trees do not usually grow continuously throughout
the year but mostly have spurts of active expansion
followed by periods of rest. This pattern of growth is
related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases
when conditions are either too cold or too dry. In
readiness for the inactive period, trees form buds to
protect the meristem, the zone of active growth.
Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves
Dormant Magnolia bud
produced at the tip of a twig form scales. These are
thick, small and closely wrapped and enclose the
growing point in a waterproof sheath. Inside this bud
there is a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand
when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the leaves ready
to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the eucalyptus, have "naked buds"
with no protective scales and some conifers, such as the Lawson's cypress, have no
buds but instead have little pockets of meristem concealed among the scale-like
leaves.[70]
When growing conditions improve, such as the arrival of warmer weather and the
longer days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts again. The
expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the process. These leave
behind scars on the surface of the twig. The whole year's growth may take place in
just a few weeks. The new stem is unligniﬁed at ﬁrst and may be green and downy.
The Arecaceae (palms) have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched
trunk.[70] In some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a
Lammas growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss
of early foliage to insect predators.[71]
Primary growth is the elongation of the stems and roots. Secondary growth consists
of a progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the
epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and
xylem cells. The bark is inelastic.[72] Eventually the growth of a tree slows down and
stops and it gets no taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.[73]

Leaves
Leaves are structures specialised for photosynthesis and are arranged on the tree in
such a way as to maximise their exposure to light without shading each other.[74]
They are an important investment by the tree and may be thorny or contain
phytoliths, lignins, tannins or poisons to discourage herbivory. Trees have evolved
leaves in a wide range of shapes and sizes, in response to environmental pressures
including climate and predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or
compound, lobed or entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or
evergreen. The needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar
to those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments where
resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water availability and
conifers are often found in colder places at higher altitudes and higher latitudes than
broad leaved trees. In conifers such as ﬁr trees, the branches hang down at an angle
to the trunk, enabling them to shed snow. In contrast, broad leaved trees in
temperate regions deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves. When the days
get shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer make new
chlorophyll and the red and yellow pigments already present in the blades become
apparent.[74] Synthesis in the leaf of a plant hormone called auxin also ceases. This
causes the cells at the junction of the petiole and the twig to weaken until the joint
breaks and the leaf ﬂoats to the ground. In tropical and subtropical regions, many
trees keep their leaves all year round. Individual leaves may fall intermittently and
be replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time. Other
tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves annually, such as
at the start of the dry season.[75] Many deciduous trees ﬂower before the new leaves
emerge.[76] A few trees do not have true leaves but instead have structures with
similar external appearance such as Phylloclades – modiﬁed stem structures[77] – as
seen in the genus Phyllocladus.[78]

Reproduction
Trees can be pollinated either by wind or by animals, mostly insects. Many
angiosperm trees are insect pollinated. Wind pollination may take advantage of
increased wind speeds high above the ground.[79] Trees use a variety of methods of
seed dispersal. Some rely on wind, with winged or plumed seeds. Others rely on
animals, for example with edible fruits. Others again eject their seeds (ballistic
dispersal), or use gravity so that seeds fall and sometimes roll.[80]

Seeds
Seeds are the primary way that trees reproduce and their seeds vary greatly in size
and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree,
Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces one of the smallest tree seeds.[81] The great
diversity in tree fruits and seeds reﬂects the many diﬀerent ways that tree species
have evolved to disperse their oﬀspring.
For a tree seedling to grow into an adult tree it needs light. If seeds only fell straight
to the ground, competition among the concentrated saplings and the shade of the
parent would likely prevent it from ﬂourishing. Many seeds such as birch are small
and have papery wings to aid dispersal by the wind. Ash trees and maples have

larger seeds with blade shaped wings which spiral
down to the ground when released. The kapok tree
has cottony threads to catch the breeze.[82]
The seeds of conifers, the largest group of
gymnosperms, are enclosed in a cone and most
species have seeds that are light and papery that can
be blown considerable distances once free from the
cone.[83] Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for
years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire
stimulates release and germination of seeds of the
Wind dispersed seed of elm
jack pine, and also enriches the forest ﬂoor with wood
(Ulmus), ash (Fraxinus) and
ash and removes competing vegetation.[84] Similarly,
maple (Acer)
a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops
and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate
better after exposure to high temperatures.[85]
The ﬂame tree Delonix regia does not rely on ﬁre but shoots its seeds through the air
when the two sides of its long pods crack apart explosively on drying.[82] The
miniature cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small droplets
of oil that help disperse the seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in
water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that
start germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree.[86][87] These ﬂoat
on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take
root.[82]
Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have ﬂeshy receptacles and smaller
fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including
mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow them so
they pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings well away from
the parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed
in this way.[88] Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not
immediately consumed.[89] Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing
softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring.[90] Pine cones may
similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the
seed by raiding squirrel caches.[91]
The single extant species of Ginkgophyta (Ginkgo biloba) has ﬂeshy seeds produced
at the ends of short branches on female trees,[92] and Gnetum, a tropical and
subtropical group of gymnosperms produce seeds at the tip of a shoot axis.[93]

Evolutionary history
The earliest trees were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, which grew in forests in
the Carboniferous period. The ﬁrst tree may have been Wattieza, fossils of which
have been found in New York State in 2007 dating back to the Middle Devonian
(about 385 million years ago). Prior to this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest
known tree.[94] Both of these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are
considered to be links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the
Triassic period. The gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos
and these may have appeared as a result of a whole genome duplication event which

took place about 319 million years ago.[95] Ginkgophyta was
once a widespread diverse group[96] of which the only
survivor is the maidenhair tree Ginkgo biloba. This is
considered to be a living fossil because it is virtually
unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic
deposits.[97]
During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 million years ago) the
conifers ﬂourished and became adapted to live in all the
major terrestrial habitats. Subsequently, the tree forms of
ﬂowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period.
These began to displace the conifers during the Tertiary era
(66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the
globe.[98] When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and
the ﬁrst of four ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as
the ice advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the
land that had been covered by ice, only to be driven back
again in the next ice age.[98]

Ecology

Lepidodendron, an
extinct lycophyte tree

Trees are an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem,[99]
providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest
for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as
ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of
parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches;[100]
these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide
micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms,
including animals. Leaves, ﬂowers and fruits are seasonally
available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade,
and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, and decaying
wood that provide other habitat.[101][102] Trees stabilise the
soil, prevent rapid run-oﬀ of rain water, help prevent
desertiﬁcation, have a role in climate control and help in
the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.[103]
Palms and cycads as
Many species of tree support their own specialised
they might have
invertebrates. In their natural habitats, 284 diﬀerent
appeared in the middle
species of insect have been found on the English oak
Tertiary
(Quercus robur)[104] and 306 species of invertebrate on the
Tasmanian oak (Eucalyptus obliqua).[105] Non-native tree
species provide a less biodiverse community, for example in the United Kingdom the
sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern Europe, has few
associated invertebrate species, though its bark supports a wide range of lichens,
bryophytes and other epiphytes.[106]

In ecosystems such as mangrove swamps, trees play a role in developing the habitat,
since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of ﬂow of tidal currents and
trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable

conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus mangrove swamps tend to extend
seawards in suitable locations.[107] Mangrove swamps also provide an eﬀective
buﬀer against the more damaging eﬀects of cyclones and tsunamis.[108]

Uses
Silviculture is the practice of controlling the establishment, growth, composition,
health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees.
Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide
food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that beneﬁts
people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard.[109] A small
wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove[110] and a small wood or
thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse.[111] A large area of land
covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest.[112] An area of
woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artiﬁcial seeding is
known as a plantation.[113]

Food
Trees are the source of many of the world's best known ﬂeshy fruits. Apples, pears,
plums, cherries and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a
wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important
fruit include dates, ﬁgs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm
(Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make
cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coﬀee trees, Coﬀea arabica and Coﬀea
canephora, are processed to extract the coﬀee beans. In many rural areas of the
world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption.[114] Many trees bear
edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a
hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia
excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis),
walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in
nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as
dietary ﬁbre.[115] A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use;
some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive
ﬂavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.[116]

Sugar maple (Acer saccharum)
tapped to collect sap for maple
syrup

In temperate climates there is a sudden movement of
sap at the end of the winter as trees prepare to burst
into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar
maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the
production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90%
of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a
mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The
sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the
trees and collecting the liquid that ﬂows out of the
inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it
is heated to concentrate it and improve its ﬂavour.
Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the
sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and
collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into

an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a
syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a
hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.[117]
Various parts of trees are used as spices. These include cinnamon, made from the
bark of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and allspice, the dried small
fruits of the pimento tree (Pimenta dioica). Nutmeg is a seed found in the ﬂeshy fruit
of the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) and cloves are the unopened ﬂower buds of
the clove tree (Syzygium aromaticum).[118]
Many trees have ﬂowers rich in nectar which are attractive to bees. The production
of forest honey is an important industry in rural areas of the developing world where
it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods.[119] The
ﬂowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to make elderﬂower cordial and petals of
the plum (Prunus spp.) can be candied.[120] Sassafras oil is a ﬂavouring obtained
from distilling bark from the roots of the sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).
The leaves of trees are widely gathered as fodder for livestock and some can be
eaten by humans but they tend to be high in tannins which makes them bitter.
Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaﬀir lime (Citrus ×
hystrix) (in Thai food)[121] and Ailanthus (in Korean dishes such as bugak) and those
of the European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia
californica) are used for ﬂavouring food.[118] Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a
small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking
the leaves easier.[122]
Wood smoke can be used to preserve food. In the hot smoking process the food is
exposed to smoke and heat in a controlled environment. The food is ready to eat
when the process is complete, having been tenderised and ﬂavoured by the smoke it
has absorbed. In the cold process, the temperature is not allowed to rise above
100 °F (38 °C). The ﬂavour of the food is enhanced but raw food requires further
cooking. If it is to be preserved, meat should be cured before cold smoking.[123]

Fuel
Wood has traditionally been used for fuel, especially
in rural areas. In less developed nations it may be the
only fuel available and collecting ﬁrewood is often a
time consuming task as it becomes necessary to
travel further and further aﬁeld in the search for
fuel.[124] It is often burned ineﬀiciently on an open
ﬁre. In more developed countries other fuels are
available and burning wood is a choice rather than a
necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel
eﬀicient and new products such as wood pellets are
available to burn.[125]

Selling ﬁrewood at a market

Charcoal can be made by slow pyrolysis of wood by heating it in the absence of air in
a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very limited
amount of air. The process of converting them into charcoal takes about ﬁfteen
hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many
industrial and other uses.[126]

Timber

Roof trusses made from softwood

Timber, "trees that are grown in order to
produce wood"[127] is cut into lumber (sawn
wood) for use in construction. Wood has been an
important,
easily
available
material
for
construction since humans started building
shelters.
Engineered
wood
products
are
available which bind the particles, ﬁbres or
veneers of wood together with adhesives to form
composite materials. Plastics have taken over
from wood for some traditional uses.[128]

Wood is used in the construction of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles, poles for
power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers, fencing, hurdles, shuttering
for concrete, pipes, scaﬀolding and pallets. In housebuilding it is used in joinery, for
making joists, roof trusses, rooﬁng shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, window
frames, ﬂoor boards, parquet ﬂooring, panelling and cladding.[129]
Wood is used to construct carts, farm implements, boats,
dugout canoes and in shipbuilding. It is used for making
furniture, tool handles, boxes, ladders, musical instruments,
bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs, brooms, shoes,
baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs,
wooden screws, barrels, coﬀins, skittles, veneers, artiﬁcial
limbs, oars, skis, wooden spoons, sports equipment and
wooden balls.[129]
Wood is pulped for paper and used in the manufacture of
cardboard and made into engineered wood products for use
in construction such as ﬁbreboard, hardboard, chipboard
and plywood.[129] The wood of conifers is known as
softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.[130]

Art
Besides inspiring artists down the centuries, trees have
been used to create art. Living trees have been used in
bonsai and in tree shaping, and both living and dead
specimens have been sculpted into sometimes fantastic
shapes.[131]
Bonsai
Bonsai ( , lit. The art of growing a miniature tree or trees
in a low-sided pot or tray) is the practice of hòn non bộ
originated in China and spread to Japan more than a
thousand years ago, there are similar practices in other
cultures like the living miniature landscapes of Vietnam hòn

Informal upright style of
bonsai on a juniper tree

non bộ. The word bonsai is often used in English as an umbrella term for all
miniature trees in containers or pots.[132]
The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant
exercise of eﬀort and ingenuity (for the grower).[133] Bonsai practice focuses on longterm cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees growing in a container,
beginning with a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai
development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree
or shrub species[134] that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain
small through pot conﬁnement with crown and root pruning. Some species are
popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or
needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a
miniature deciduous forest can even be created using such species as Japanese
maple, Japanese zelkova or hornbeam.[135]
Tree shaping
Tree shaping is the practice of changing living trees
and other woody plants into man made shapes for art
and useful structures. There are a few diﬀerent
methods[136] of shaping a tree. There is a gradual
method and there is an instant method. The gradual
method slowly guides the growing tip along
predetermined pathways over time whereas the
instant method bends and weaves saplings 2 to 3 m
(6.6 to 9.8 ft) long into a shape that becomes more
People trees, by Pooktre
rigid as they thicken up.[137] Most artists use grafting
of living trunks, branches, and roots, for art or
functional structures and there are plans to grow
"living houses" with the branches of trees knitting together to give a solid,
weatherproof exterior combined with an interior application of straw and clay to
provide a stucco-like inner surface.[137]
Tree shaping has been practised for at least several hundred years, the oldest known
examples being the living root bridges built and maintained by the Khasi people of
Meghalaya, India using the roots of the rubber tree (Ficus elastica).[138][139]

Bark
Cork is produced from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested
from the living trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable
industry.[140] More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely
used to make stoppers for wine bottles.[141] Other uses include ﬂoor tiles, bulletin
boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind
instruments.[141]
The bark of other varieties of oak has traditionally been used in Europe for the
tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere.
The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments,

the skins are immersed in a series of vats containing
solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes
the hide to become supple, less aﬀected by water and more
resistant to bacterial attack.[142]
At least 120 drugs come from plant sources, many of them
from the bark of trees.[143] Quinine originates from the
cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the
remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria.[144] Aspirin
was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived
from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant
side eﬀects.[145] The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived
from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Paciﬁc yew
(Taxus brevifolia).[146] Other tree based drugs come from
the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the
cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca
acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).[143]

Recently stripped cork
oak (Quercus suber)

The papery bark of the white birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used extensively by
Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes were constructed from
it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and ﬁshing equipment, musical
instruments, toys and sledges.[147] Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of the timber
industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that
need a soil-free compost.[148]

Ornamental trees

Trees create a visual impact in the same way as do
other landscape features and give a sense of maturity
and permanence to park and garden. They are grown
for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, ﬂowers,
fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance
in creating a landscape. They can be grouped
informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs,
laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees.
As living things, their appearance changes with the
season and from year to year.[149]

Trees are often planted in town environments where they are known as street trees
or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through evapotranspiration,
absorb greenhouse gases and pollutants, intercept rainfall, and reduce the risk of
ﬂooding. Scientiﬁc studies show that street trees help cities be more sustainable,
and improve the physical and mental wellbeing of the citizens. [150] It has been
shown that they are beneﬁcial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and
reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes.[151] In London
for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an
increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.[152]

Other uses

Latex is a sticky defensive secretion that protects plants
against herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured but
the main source of the latex used to make natural rubber is
the Pará rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Originally used to
create bouncy balls and for the waterprooﬁng of cloth,
natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for which
synthetic materials have proved less durable.[153] The latex
exuded by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to
make golf balls and is similar to gutta-percha, made from
the latex of the "getah perca" tree Palaquium. This is also
used as an insulator, particularly of undersea cables, and in
dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely
been replaced by synthetic materials.[154]

Latex collecting from a
rubber tree (Hevea
brasiliensis)

Resin is another plant exudate that may have a defensive
purpose. It is a viscous liquid composed mainly of volatile
terpenes and is produced mostly by coniferous trees. It is
used in varnishes, for making small castings and in ten-pin
bowling balls. When heated, the terpenes are driven oﬀ and the remaining product is
called "rosin" and is used by stringed instrumentalists on their bows. Some resins
contain essential oils and are used in incense and aromatherapy. Fossilised resin is
known as amber and was mostly formed in the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years
ago) or more recently. The resin that oozed out of trees sometimes trapped insects or
spiders and these are still visible in the interior of the amber.[155]
The camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) produces an essential oil[118] and the
eucalyptus tree (Eucalyptus globulus) is the main source of eucalyptus oil which is
used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.[156]

Care
Dead trees pose a safety risk, especially during high winds and severe storms, and
removing dead trees involves a ﬁnancial burden, whereas the presence of healthy
trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce the temperature of the
built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of
drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more
susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death.
Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death.[157]

Mythology
Trees have been venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts, certain
trees, especially the oak, ash and thorn, held special signiﬁcance[158] as providing
fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have
similarly revered trees, often linking the lives and fortunes of individuals to them or
using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads were believed to be shy nymphs
who inhabited trees.
The Oubangui people of west Africa plant a tree when a child is born. As the tree
ﬂourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive, the health of the child is
considered at risk. When it ﬂowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree

periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is
believed to live on in the tree.[159]
Trees have their roots in the ground and their trunk and
branches extended towards the sky. This concept is found in
many of the world's religions as a tree which links the
underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens. In
Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose
roots and branches extend to various worlds. Various
creatures live on it.[160] In India, Kalpavriksha is a wishfulﬁlling tree, one of the nine jewels that emerged from the
Yggdrasil, the World Ash
primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be
of Norse mythology
worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants
favours to the devout who tie threads round the trunk.[161]
Democracy started in North America when the Great
Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy, inspiring the warriors of the original
ﬁve American nations to bury their weapons under the Tree of Peace, an eastern
white pine (Pinus strobus).[162] In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and
the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of Eden.[163]
Sacred groves exist in China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They are places where the
deities live and where all the living things are either sacred or are companions of the
gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural penalties that will result if desecration
takes place for example by the felling of trees. Because of their protected status,
sacred groves may be the only relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much
greater than the surrounding area.[164] Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as
Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or Kadambariyamman,
associated with the kadamba tree were seen as manifestations of a goddess who
oﬀers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.[165]

Superlative trees
Trees have a theoretical maximum height of 130 m
(430 ft),[166] but the tallest known specimen on earth is
believed to be a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) at
Redwood National Park, California. It has been named
Hyperion and is 115.85 m (380.1 ft) tall.[167] In 2006, it was
reported to be 379.1 ft (115.5 m) tall.[168] The tallest known
broad-leaved tree is a mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans)
growing in Tasmania with a height of 99.8 m (327 ft).[169]
The largest tree by volume is believed to be a giant sequoia
(Sequoiadendron giganteum) known as the General
Sherman Tree in the Sequoia National Park in Tulare
County, California. Only the trunk is used in the calculation
and the volume is estimated to be 1,487 m3
(52,500 cu ft).[170]

Tree, thought to be the
world's largest by
volume

The oldest living tree with a veriﬁed age is also in
California. It is a Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus
longaeva) growing in the White Mountains. It has been dated by drilling a core

sample and counting the annual rings. It is estimated to currently be 5,069 years
old.[a][171]
A little farther south, at Santa Maria del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico, is the tree with the
broadest trunk. It is a Montezuma cypress (Taxodium mucronatum) known as Árbol
del Tule and its diameter at breast height is 11.62 m (38.1 ft) giving it a girth of
36.2 m (119 ft). The tree's trunk is far from round and the exact dimensions may be
misleading as the circumference includes much empty space between the large
buttress roots.[172]
