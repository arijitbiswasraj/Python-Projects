Space Shuttle
The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable low
Earth orbital spacecraft system that was operated
from 1981 to 2011 by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space
Shuttle program. Its oﬀicial program name was
Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a
1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of
which it was the only item funded for development.[4]
The ﬁrst of four orbital test ﬂights occurred in 1981,
leading to operational ﬂights beginning in 1982. Five
complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built
and ﬂown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to
2011, launched from the Kennedy Space Center
(KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched
numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST); conducted science
experiments
in
orbit;
and
participated
in
construction and servicing of the International Space
Station. The Space Shuttle ﬂeet's total mission time
was 1322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23
seconds.[5]
Space Shuttle components include the Orbiter
Vehicle (OV) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25
main engines, a pair of recoverable solid rocket
boosters (SRBs), and the expendable external tank
(ET) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
The Space Shuttle was launched vertically, like a
conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in
parallel with the orbiter's three main engines, which
were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned
before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was
jettisoned just before orbit insertion, which used the
orbiter's two Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS)
engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter
ﬁred its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere.
The orbiter was protected during reentry by its
thermal protection system tiles, and it glided as a
spaceplane to a runway landing, usually to the
Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC, Florida, or to Rogers
Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base, California. If
the landing occurred at Edwards, the orbiter was
ﬂown back to the KSC on the Shuttle Carrier
Aircraft, a specially modiﬁed Boeing 747.

The ﬁrst orbiter, Enterprise, was built in 1976, used
in Approach and Landing Tests and has no orbital
capability. Four fully operational orbiters were
initially built: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and
Atlantis. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents:
Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003, with a
total of fourteen astronauts killed. A ﬁfth operational
(and sixth in total) orbiter, Endeavour, was built in
1991 to replace Challenger. The Space Shuttle was
retired from service upon the conclusion of Atlantis 's
ﬁnal ﬂight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. relied on the
Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to
the International Space Station from the last Shuttle
ﬂight until the ﬁrst Commercial Crew Development
launch on May 30, 2020.

Design and development
Historical background
During the 1950s, the
United
States
Air
Force proposed using
a reusable piloted
glider
to
perform
The X-24A, M2-F3, and HL-10
military
operations
lifting bodies
such
as
reconnaissance,
satellite attack, and
air-to-ground weapons employment. In the late
1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially
reusable X-20 Dyna-Soar. The Air Force collaborated
with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six
pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development
and the prioritization of Project Gemini led to the
cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December
1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had
conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of
reusable boosters. This became the basis for the
aerospaceplane, a fully reusable spacecraft that was
never developed beyond the initial design phase in
1962–1963.[6]:162–163
Beginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air
Force collaborated on developing lifting bodies to
test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their
fuselages instead of wings, and tested the M2-F1,
M2-F2, M2-F3, HL-10, X-24A, and the X-24B. The
program tested aerodynamic characteristics that
would later be incorporated in design of the Space
Shuttle, including unpowered landing from a high
altitude and speed.[7]:142[8]:16–18

discusses the chosen Shuttle
solution.[6]:164 The head of the NASA Oﬀice of
design with NASA Administrator
Manned Space Flight, George Mueller, announced the
James Fletcher in January 1972
plan for a reusable shuttle on August 10, 1968. NASA
issued a request for proposal (RFP) for designs of the
Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which
would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon
initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle
contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by
competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two
contractors for a speciﬁc contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the
spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.[9][8]:19–22
In December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the
optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to General
Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and North American Rockwell. In July
1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle
would support short-duration crewed missions and space station, as well as the
capabilities to launch, service, and retrieve satellites. The report also created three
classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted
on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a
single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable
orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under
leadership of Vice President Spiro Agnew, issued a report calling for the
development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO),
as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable
nuclear upper stage for deep space travel.[6]:163–166[4]
After the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers
favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware
costs. Max Faget, a NASA engineer who had worked to design the Mercury capsule,
patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged
orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.[10][11] The Air Force Flight
Dynamics Laboratory argued that a straight-wing design would not be able to
withstand the high thermal and aerodynamic stresses during reentry, and would not
provide the required cross-range capability. Additionally, the Air Force required a
larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air
Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an
expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.[6]:166

After they established the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the
Air Force determined the design requirements of their respective services. The Air
Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to
be capable of lifting 29,000 kg (65,000 lb) to an eastward LEO or 18,000 kg
(40,000 lb) into a polar orbit. The satellite designs also required that the Space
Shuttle have a 4.6 by 18 m (15 by 60 ft) payload bay. NASA evaluated the F-1 and J-2
engines from the Saturn rockets, and determined that they were insuﬀicient for the
requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to Rocketdyne to
begin development on the RS-25 engine.[6]:165–170
NASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a
design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to
reduce costs.[6]:167 NASA and the Air Force elected to use solid-propellant boosters
because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they
landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President Richard Nixon approved the Shuttle,
and NASA decided on its ﬁnal design in March. That August, NASA awarded the
contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster
contract to Morton Thiokol, and the external tank contract to Martin
Marietta.[6]:170–173

Development
On June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the
ﬁrst orbiter, OV-101, which would later be named
Enterprise. Enterprise was designed as a test vehicle,
and did not include engines or heat shielding.
Construction was completed on September 17, 1976,
and Enterprise was moved to the Edwards Air Force
Base to begin testing.[6]:173[12] Rockwell constructed
the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which
was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three
RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the National
Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL) to ensure that
the engines could safely run through the launch
proﬁle.[13]:II-163 Rockwell conducted mechanical and
thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article
(STA)-099 to determine the eﬀects of aerodynamic
and

reentry.

Columbia undergoing
installation of its ceramic tiles

The beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was
delayed for nine months while Pratt & Whitney challenged the contract that had
been issued to Rocketdyne. The ﬁrst engine was completed in March 1975, after
issues with developing the ﬁrst throttleable, reusable engine. During engine testing,
the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades.
Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed
for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.[6]:174–175
NASA experienced signiﬁcant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's
thermal protection system. Previous NASA spacecraft had used ablative heat shields,
but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal
protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight aluminum, and

the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on Columbia
on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.[6]:175–177 At
the time of its arrival at the KSC, Columbia still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles
remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally
installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before Columbia
could ﬂy.[8]:46–48
On January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month,
Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named Challenger. On January
29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were
named Discovery and Atlantis. Construction of OV-105, later named Endeavour,
began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle ﬂeet to four
orbiters in 1983. After the loss of Challenger, NASA resumed production of
Endeavour in September 1987.[8]:52–53

Testing
After it arrived at Edwards AFB, Enterprise
underwent ﬂight testing with the Shuttle Carrier
Aircraft, a Boeing 747 that had been modiﬁed to carry
the orbiter. In February 1977, Enterprise began the
Approach and Landing Tests and underwent captive
ﬂights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle
Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the ﬂight. On
August 12, 1977, Enterprise conducted its ﬁrst glide
Enterprise during the Approach
test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier
and Landing Tests
Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.[6]:173–174 After
four additional ﬂights, Enterprise was moved to the
Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) on March 13,
1978. Enterprise underwent shake tests in the Mated
Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an
external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent
vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979,
Enterprise was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to
an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to
LC-39. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle
was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex
hardware. Enterprise was taken back to California in
August 1979, and later served in the development of the
SLC-6 at Vandenberg AFB in 1984.[8]:40–41
On November 24, 1980, Columbia was mated with its
Columbia launching on
external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to
STS-1[b]
LC-39 on December 29.[13]:III-22 The ﬁrst Space Shuttle
mission, STS-1, would be the ﬁrst time NASA performed a
crewed ﬁrst-ﬂight of a spacecraft.[13]:III-24 On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle
launched for the ﬁrst time, and was piloted by John Young and Robert Crippen.
During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the
shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen oﬀ the top side of the

Columbia.[14]:277-278 NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image
the underside of Columbia, and determined there was no damage.[14]:335-337
Columbia reentered the atmosphere and landed at Edwards AFB on April 14.[13]:III-24
NASA conducted three additional test ﬂights with Columbia in 1981 and 1982. On
July 4, 1982, STS-4, ﬂown by Ken Mattingly and Henry Hartsﬁeld, landed on a
concrete runway at Edwards AFB. President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy met
the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared its Space
Transportation System (STS) operational.[6]:178–179[15]

Description
The Space Shuttle was the ﬁrst operational orbital spacecraft designed for reuse.
Each Space Shuttle orbiter was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or
ten years of operational life, although this was later extended.[16]:11 At launch, it
consisted of the orbiter, which contained the crew and payload, the external tank
(ET), and the two solid rocket boosters (SRBs).[17]:363
Responsibility for the Shuttle components was spread among multiple NASA ﬁeld
centers. The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for
equatorial orbits (the only orbit proﬁle actually used in the program), the U.S. Air
Force at the Vandenberg Air Force Base was responsible for launch, landing and
turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the Johnson
Space Center (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC
was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the
John C. Stennis Space Center handled main engine testing, and the Goddard Space
Flight Center managed the global tracking network.[18]

Orbiter

Shuttle launch proﬁles. From left: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and
Endeavour

The orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to
allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.[17]:365 Its three-part fuselage
provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, ﬂight surfaces, and engines.
The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which

provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS),
which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its
double-delta wings were 18 m (60 ft) long, and were swept 81° at the inner leading
edge and 45° at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard
elevon to provide ﬂight control during reentry, along with a ﬂap located between the
wings, below the engines to control pitch. The orbiter's vertical stabilizer was swept
backwards at 45°, and contained a rudder that could split to act as a speed
brake.[17]:382–389 The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part drag parachute
system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used retractable landing gear
with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The
main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear
contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.[17]:408–411
Crew
The Space Shuttle crew varied by mission. The test ﬂight had only two members
each, the commander and pilot, who were both qualiﬁed pilots that could ﬂy and land
the orbiter. The on-orbit operations, such as experiments, payload deployment, and
EVAs, were conducted primarily by the mission specialists who were speciﬁcally
trained for their intended missions and systems. Early in the Space Shuttle program,
NASA ﬂew with payload specialists, who were typically systems specialists who
worked for the company paying for the payload's deployment or operations. The ﬁnal
payload specialist, Gregory B. Jarvis, ﬂew on STS-51L, and future non-pilots were
designated as mission specialists. An astronaut ﬂew as a crewed spaceﬂight engineer
on both STS-51C and STS-51J to serve as a military representative for a National
Reconnaissance Oﬀice payload. A Space Shuttle crew typically had seven astronauts,
with STS-61A ﬂying with eight.[13]:III-21
Crew compartment
The crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable
area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the
commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members.
The mid-deck was located below the cockpit, and was where the galley and crew
bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck
contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an extravehicular
activity (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay
was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management
systems.[8]:60–62[17]:365–369
On the ﬁrst four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modiﬁed U.S. Air Force highaltitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and
descent. From the ﬁfth ﬂight, STS-5, until the loss of Challenger, the crew wore onepiece light blue nomex ﬂight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the Challenger
disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure
version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was
replaced by the full-pressure Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES), which improved
the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. Columbia originally had
modiﬁed SR-71 zero-zero ejection seats installed for the ALT and ﬁrst four missions,
but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after STS-9.[17]:370–371

The ﬂight deck was the top level of the crew
compartment, and contained the ﬂight controls for
the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat,
and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to
four additional seats set up for additional crew
members. The instrument panels contained over
2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and
pilot were both equipped with a heads-up display
(HUD) and a Rotational Hand Controller (RHC) to
Atlantis was the ﬁrst Shuttle to
gimbal the engines during powered ﬂight and ﬂy the
ﬂy with a glass cockpit, on STSorbiter during unpowered ﬂight. Both seats also had
101.
rudder controls, to allow rudder movement in ﬂight
and nose-wheel steering on the ground.[17]:369–372
The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction CRT Display
System (MCDS) to display and control ﬂight information. The MCDS displayed the
ﬂight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating
location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, Atlantis was upgraded
with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a glass cockpit
upgrade to the ﬂight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11
multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was ﬂown for the ﬁrst time in May 2000
on STS-98, and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the
ﬂight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to
control the Remote Manipulator System during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft
ﬂight deck had monitors for a closed-circuit television to view the cargo
bay.[17]:372–376
The mid-deck contained the crew equipment storage, sleeping area, galley, medical
equipment, and hygiene stations for the crew. The crew used modular lockers to
store equipment that could be scaled depending on their needs, as well as
permanently installed ﬂoor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch
that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was
originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was
replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on Discovery, Atlantis, and
Endeavour to improve docking with Mir and the ISS, along with the Orbiter Docking
System.[13]:II–26–33
Flight systems
The orbiter was equipped with an avionics system to provide information and control
during atmospheric ﬂight. Its avionics suite contained three microwave scanning
beam landing systems, three gyroscopes, three TACANs, three accelerometers, two
radar altimeters, two barometric altimeters, three attitude indicators, two Mach
indicators, and two Mode C transponders. During reentry, the crew deployed two air
data probes once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three
inertial measuring units (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all
phases of ﬂight. The orbiter contains two star trackers to align the IMUs while in
orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or
manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement
units with an inertial navigation system (INS), which provided more accurate
location information. In 1993, NASA ﬂew a GPS receiver for the ﬁrst time aboard

STS-51. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the
IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which ﬁrst ﬂew on STS-118 in August
2007[17]:402–403
While in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four S band radios,
which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were
phase modulation transceivers, and could transmit and receive information. The
other two S band radios were frequency modulation transmitters, and were used to
transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their line of sight,
NASA used the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and the Spacecraft
Tracking and Data Acquisition Network ground stations to communicate with the
orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth Kuband radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The
orbiter was also equipped with two UHF radios for communications with air traﬀic
control and astronauts conducting EVA.[17]:403–404
The Space Shuttle's ﬂy-by-wire control system was
entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data
Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the
ﬂight controls and thrusters on the orbiter, as well as
the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of
ﬁve general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic
tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated
sensors
to
monitors
the
Space
Shuttle
[17]:232–233
components.
The original GPC used was
AP-101S (left) and AP-101B
the IBM AP-101B, which used a separate central
general purpose computers
processing unit (CPU) and input/output processor
(IOP), and non-volatile solid-state memory. From
1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to
the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced
the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single
unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System
(PASS), which was Space Shuttle-speciﬁc software that provided control through all
phases of ﬂight. During ascent, maneuvering, reentry, and landing, the four PASS
GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error
check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports
from the four PASS GPCs, a ﬁfth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a
diﬀerent program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and
reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The ﬁve GPCs were separated in
three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a
cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs
functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management
(SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.[17]:405–408 The Space
Shuttle was not launched if its ﬂight would run from December to January, as its
ﬂight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the
year change. In 2007, NASA engineers devised a solution so Space Shuttle ﬂights
could cross the year-end boundary.[19]
Space Shuttle missions typically brought a portable general support computer
(PGSC) that could integrate with the orbiter vehicle's computers and communication
suite, as well as monitor scientiﬁc and payload data. Early missions brought the Grid

Compass, one of the ﬁrst laptop computers, as the PGSC, but later missions brought
Apple and Intel laptops.[17]:408[20]
Payload bay
The payload bay comprised most of the orbiter
vehicle's fuselage, and provided the cargo-carrying
space for the Space Shuttle's payloads. It was 18 m
(60 ft) long and 4.6 m (15 ft) wide, and could
accommodate cylindrical payloads up to 4.6 m (15 ft)
in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either
side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal
to protect payloads from heating during launch and
reentry. Payloads were secured in the payload bay to
the attachment points on the longerons. The payload
bay doors served an additional function as radiators
for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon
reaching orbit for heat rejection.[8]:62–64

The orbiter could be used in conjunction with a
variety of add-on components depending on the
mission. This included orbital laboratories,[13]:II-304, 319 boosters for launching
payloads farther into space,[13]:II-326 the Remote Manipulator System(RMS),[13]:II-40
and to extend the mission duration.[13]:II-86 To limit the fuel consumption while the
orbiter was docked at the ISS, the Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS)
was developed to convert and transfer station power to the orbiter.[13]:II-87-88 The
SSPTS was ﬁrst used on STS-118, and was installed on Discovery and
Endeavour.[13]:III-366-368
Remote Manipulator System
The RMS, also known as Canadarm, was a mechanical arm attached to the cargo bay.
It could be used to grasp and manipulate payloads, as well as serve as a mobile
platform for astronauts conducting an EVA. The RMS was built by the Canadian
company Spar Aerospace, and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's
ﬂight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for
six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm. The
original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to 29,000 kg (65,000 lb), which
was later improved to 270,000 kg (586,000 lb).[17]:384–385
Spacelab
The Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was
carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientiﬁc research while in orbit. The
Spacelab module contained two 2.7 m (9 ft) segments that were mounted in the aft
end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during ﬂight. Astronauts
entered the Spacelab module through a 2.7 m (8.72 ft) or 5.8 m (18.88 ft) tunnel that
connected to the airlock. The Spacelab equipment was primarily stored in pallets,
which provided storage for both experiments as well as computer and power
equipment.[17]:434–435 Spacelab hardware was ﬂown on 28 missions through 1999,

and
studied
subjects
including
astronomy,
microgravity, radar, and life sciences. Spacelab
hardware also supported missions such as Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) servicing and space station
resupply. The Spacelab module was tested STS-2 and
STS-3, and the ﬁrst full mission was on STS-9.[21]
RS-25 engines
Three RS-25 engines, also known as the Space
Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), were mounted on the
orbiter's aft fuselage in a triangular pattern. The
engine nozzles could gimbal ±10.5° in pitch, and
±8.5° in yaw during ascent to change the direction of
their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The titanium alloy
reusable engines were independent from the orbiter
vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in
between ﬂights. The RS-25 is a staged-combustion
cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and
hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than
any previous liquid rocket. The original main
combustion chamber operated at a maximum
pressure of 226.5 bar (3,285 psi). The engine nozzle
is 287 cm (113 in) tall and has an interior diameter of
229 cm (90.3 in). The nozzle is cooled by 1,080
interior lines carrying liquid hydrogen, and is
thermally protected by insulative and ablative
material.[13]:II–177–183

RS-25 engines with the two
Orbital Maneuvering System
(OMS) pods

The RS-25 engines had several improvements to enhance reliability and power.
During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was
capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally speciﬁed thrust. To keep
the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA
kept the original speciﬁed thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher
thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust
level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, which reduced the chamber
pressure to 207.5 bars (3,010 psi), as it had a larger throat area. The normal
maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission
aborts.[8]:106–107
Orbital Maneuvering System
The Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted AJ10-190
engines and the associated propellant tanks. The AJ10 engines used
monomethylhydrazine (MMH) oxidized by dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The pods
carried a maximum of 2,140 kg (4,718 lb) of MMH and 3,526 kg (7,773 lb) of N2O4.
The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-oﬀ (MECO) for orbital insertion.
Throughout the ﬂight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn
prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced 27,080 N (6,087 lbf) of thrust, and the
entire system could provide 305 m/s (1,000 ft/s) of velocity change.[13]:II–80

Thermal protection system
The orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system
(TPS), a thermal soaking protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with
previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the
orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.[8]:72–73 During reentry, the TPS experienced
temperatures up to 1,600 °C (3,000 °F), but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's
aluminum skin temperature below 180 °C (350 °F). The TPS primarily consisted of
four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced
temperatures above 1,300 °C (2,300 °F), and were protected by reinforced carboncarbon tiles (RCC). Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to
prevent damage from micrometeoroid and orbital debris, and were further improved
after RCC damage caused in the Columbia disaster. Beginning with STS-114, the
orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system
to alert the crew to any potential damage.[13]:II–112–113 The entire underside of the
orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with hightemperature reusable surface insulation. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter
vehicle were coated in a white low-temperature reusable surface insulation, which
provided protection for temperatures below 650 °C (1,200 °F). The payload bay
doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were coated in reusable felt surface
insulation, as the temperature there remained below 370 °C (700 °F).[17]:395

External tank
The Space Shuttle external tank (ET) carried the
propellant for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and
connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket
boosters. The ET was 47 m (153.8 ft) tall and 8.4 m
(27.6 ft) in diameter, and contained separate tanks for
liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2). The
LOX tank was housed in the nose of the ET, and was
15 m (49.3 ft) tall. The LH2 comprised the bulk of the
ET, and was 29 m (96.7 ft) tall. The orbiter vehicle
was attached to the ET at two umbilical plates, which
contained ﬁve propellant and two electrical
umbilicals,
and
forward
and
aft
structural
attachments. The exterior of the ET was covered in
orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of
ascent.[17]:421–422

The external tank after
separation on STS-29

The ET provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoﬀ until main
engine cutoﬀ. The ET separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine
cutoﬀ, and could be triggered automatically or manually. At the time of separation,
the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed
to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle. After the bolts
attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the ET separated from the
orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose
to cause the ET to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The ET was
the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it
would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Paciﬁc Ocean.[17]:422

For the ﬁrst two missions, STS-1 and STS-2, the ET was covered in 270 kg (595 lb) of
white ﬁre-retardant latex paint to provide protection against damage from ultraviolet
radiation. Further research determined that the foam itself was suﬀiciently
protected, and the ET was no longer covered in latex paint beginning on STS3.[13]:II-210 A light-weight tank (LWT) was ﬁrst ﬂown on STS-6, which reduced tank
weight by 4,700 kg (10,300 lb). The LWT's weight was reduced by removing
components from the LH2 tank and reducing the thickness of some skin
panels.[17]:422 In 1998, a super light-weight ET (SLWT) ﬁrst ﬂew on STS-91. The
SLWT used the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy, which was 40% stronger and 10% less
dense than its predecessor, 2219 aluminum-lithium alloy. The SLWT weighed
3,400 kg (7,500 lb) less than the LWT, which allowed the Space Shuttle to deliver
heavy elements to ISS's high inclination orbit.[17]:423-424

Solid Rocket Boosters

(SRB)

tall and 3.7 m (12.2 ft)
wide,
weighed
68,000
kg
(150,000 lb), and had a steel exterior approximately
13 mm (.5 in) thick. The SRB's subcomponents were
the solid-propellant motor, nose cone, and rocket
nozzle. The solid-propellant motor comprised the
majority of the SRB's structure. Its casing consisted
Two SRBs on the mobile
of 11 steel sections which made up its four main
launcher platform prior to
segments. The nose cone housed the forward
mating with the ET and orbiter
separation motors and the parachute systems that
were used during recovery. The rocket nozzles could
gimbal up to 8° to allow for in-ﬂight adjustments.[17]:425–429
The rocket motors were each ﬁlled with a total 500,000 kg (1,106,640 lb) of solid
rocket propellant, and joined together in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at
KSC.[17]:425–426 In addition to providing thrust during the ﬁrst stage of launch, the
SRBs provided structural support for the orbiter vehicle and ET, as they were the
only system that was connected to the mobile launcher platform (MLP).[17]:427 At the
time of launch, the SRBs were armed at T-5 minutes, and could only be electrically
ignited once the RS-25 engines had ignited and were without issue.[17]:428 They each
provided 12,500 kN (2,800,000 lbf) of thrust, which was later improved to 13,300 kN
(3,000,000 lbf) beginning on STS-8.[17]:425 After expending their fuel, the SRBs were
jettisoned approximately two minutes after launch at an altitude of approximately
46 km (150,000 ft). Following separation, they deployed drogue and main
parachutes, landed in the ocean, and were recovered by the crews aboard the ships

MV Freedom Star and MV Liberty Star.[17]:430 Once they were returned to Cape
Canaveral, they were cleaned and disassembled. The rocket motor, igniter, and
nozzle were then shipped to Thiokol to be refurbished and reused on subsequent
ﬂights.[8]:124
The SRBs underwent several redesigns throughout the program's lifetime. STS-6 and
STS-7 used SRBs that were 2,300 kg (5,000 lb) lighter than the standard-weight
cases due to walls that were 0.10 mm (.004 in) thinner, but were determined to be
too thin. Subsequent ﬂights until STS-26 used cases that were 0.076 mm (.003 in)
thinner than the standard-weight cases, which saved 1,800 kg (4,000 lb). After the
Challenger disaster as a result of an O-ring failing at low temperature, the SRBs
were redesigned to provide a constant seal regardless of the ambient
temperature.[17]:425–426

Support vehicles
The Space Shuttle's operations were supported by vehicles and infrastructure that
facilitated its transportation, construction, and crew access. The crawlertransporters carried the MLP and the Space Shuttle from the VAB to the launch
site.[23] The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) were two modiﬁed Boeing 747s that could
carry an orbiter on its back. The original SCA (N905NA) was ﬁrst ﬂown in 1975, and
was used for the ALT and ferrying the orbiter from Edwards AFB to the KSC on all
missions prior to 1991. A second SCA (N911NA) was acquired in 1988, and was ﬁrst
used to transport Endeavour from the factory to the KSC. Following the retirement of
the Space Shuttle, N905NA was put on display at the JSC, and N911NA was put on
display at the Joe Davis Heritage Airpark in Palmdale, California.[13]:I–377–391[24] The
Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV) was a modiﬁed airport jet bridge that was used to
assist astronauts to egress from the orbiter after landing, where they would undergo
their post-mission medical checkups.[25] The Astrovan transported astronauts from
the crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building to the launch pad on
launch day.[26] The NASA Railroad comprised three locomotives that transported
SRB segments from the Florida East Coast Railway in Titusville to the KSC.[27]

Mission proﬁle
Launch preparation
The Space Shuttle was prepared for launch primarily
in the VAB at the KSC. The SRBs were assembled and
attached to the external tank on the MLP. The orbiter
vehicle was prepared at the Orbiter Processing
Facility (OPF) and transferred to the VAB, where a
crane was used to rotate it to the vertical orientation
and mate it to the external tank.[8]:132–133 Once the
entire stack was assembled, the MLP was carried for
5.6 km (3.5 mi) to Launch Complex 39 by one of the
crawler-transporters.[8]:137 After the Space Shuttle
arrived at one of the two launchpads, it would
connect to the Fixed and Rotation Service Structures,

transportation.
The crew was transported to the launch pad at T−3 hours
and entered the orbiter vehicle, which was closed at T−2 hours.[13]:III–8 LOX and LH2
were loaded into the external tank via umbilicals that attached to the orbiter vehicle,
which began at T−5 hours 35 minutes. At T−3 hours 45 minutes, the LH2 fast-ﬁll was
complete, followed 15 minutes later by the LOX. Both tanks were slowly ﬁlled up
until the launch as the oxygen and hydrogen evaporated.[13]:II–186
The launch commit criteria considered precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover,
lightning forecast, wind, and humidity.[28] The Space Shuttle was not launched under
conditions where it could have been struck by lightning, as its exhaust plume could
have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground after launch, which
occurred on Apollo 12.[29]:239 The NASA Anvil Rule for a Shuttle launch stated that
an anvil cloud could not appear within a distance of 19 km (10 nmi).[30] The Shuttle
Launch Weather Oﬀicer monitored conditions until the ﬁnal decision to scrub a
launch was announced. In addition to the weather at the launch site, conditions had
to be acceptable at one of the Transatlantic Abort Landing sites and the SRB
recovery area.[28][31]

Launch
The mission crew and the Launch Control Center
(LCC) personnel completed systems checks
throughout the countdown. Two built-in holds at
T−20 minutes and T−9 minutes provided
scheduled breaks to address any issues and
additional preparation.[13]:III–8 After the built-in
hold at T−9 minutes, the countdown was
automatically controlled by the Ground Launch
Sequencer (GLS) at the LCC, which stopped the
countdown if it sensed a critical problem with
any of the Space Shuttle's onboard systems.[31]
RS-25 ignition
At T−3 minutes 45 seconds, the engines began
conducting gimbal tests, which were concluded
at T−2 minutes 15 seconds. The ground launch processing system handed oﬀ the
control to the orbiter vehicle's GPCs at T−31 seconds. At T−16 seconds, the GPCs
armed the SRBs, the sound suppression system (SPS) began to drench the MLP and
SRB trenches with 1,100,000 L (300,000 U.S. gal) of water to protect the orbiter
vehicle from damage by acoustical energy and rocket exhaust reﬂected from the
ﬂame trench and MLP during lift-oﬀ.[32][33] At T−10 seconds, hydrogen igniters were
activated under each engine bell to quell the stagnant gas inside the cones before
ignition. Failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the
possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the ﬁring phase.
The LH2 prevalves were opened at T−9.5 seconds in preparation for engine
start.[13]:II–186
Beginning at T−6.6 seconds, the main engines were ignited sequentially at 120millisecond intervals. All three RS-25 engines were required to reach 90% rated
thrust by T−3 seconds, otherwise the GPCs would initiate an RSLS abort. If all three
engines indicated nominal performance by T−3 seconds, they were commanded to
gimbal to liftoﬀ conﬁguration and the command would be issued to arm the SRBs for

ignition at T−0.[34] Between T−6.6 seconds and T−3
seconds, while the RS-25 engines were ﬁring but the
SRBs were still bolted to the pad, the oﬀset thrust
caused the Space Shuttle to pitch down 650 mm
(25.5 in) measured at the tip of the external tank; the
3-second delay allowed the stack to return to nearly
vertical before SRB ignition. At T−0 seconds, the
eight frangible nuts holding the SRBs to the pad were
detonated, the ﬁnal umbilicals were disconnected, the
SSMEs were commanded to 100% throttle, and the
SRBs were ignited.[35][36] By T+0.23 seconds, the
SRBs built up enough thrust for liftoﬀ to commence,
and reached maximum chamber pressure by T+0.6
seconds.[37][13]:II–186 At T−0, the JSC Mission Control
Center assumed control of the ﬂight from the
LCC.[13]:III–9

Solid rocket booster (SRB)
separation during STS-1

At T+4 seconds, when the Space Shuttle reached an
altitude of 22 meters (73 ft), the RS-25 engines were
throttled up to 104.5%. At approximately T+7 seconds, the Space Shuttle rolled to a
heads-down orientation at an altitude of 110 meters (350 ft), which reduced
aerodynamic stress and provided an improved communication and navigation
orientation. Approximately 20−30 seconds into ascent and an altitude of 2,700
meters (9,000 ft), the RS-25 engines were throttled down to 65−72% to reduce the
maximum aerodynamic forces at Max Q.[13]:III–8-9 Additionally, the shape of the SRB
propellant was designed to cause thrust to decrease at the time of Max Q.[17]:427 The
GPCs could dynamically control the throttle of the RS-25 engines based upon the
performance of the SRBs.[13]:II–187
At approximately T+123 seconds and an altitude of 46,000 meters (150,000 ft),
pyrotechnic fasteners released the SRBs, which reached an apogee of 67,000 meters
(220,000 ft) before parachuting into the Atlantic Ocean. The Space Shuttle continued
its ascent using only the RS-25 engines. On earlier missions the Space Shuttle
remained in the heads-down orientation to maintain communications with the
tracking station in Bermuda, but later missions, beginning with STS-87, rolled to a
heads-up orientation at T+6 minutes for communication with the tracking and data
relay satellite constellation. The RS-25 engines were throttled at T+7 minutes 30
seconds to limit vehicle acceleration to 3 g. At 6 seconds prior to main engine cutoﬀ
(MECO), which occurred at T+8 minutes 30 seconds, the RS-25 engines were
throttled down to 67%. The GPCs controlled ET separation, and dumped the
remaining LOX and LH2 to prevent outgassing while in orbit. The ET continued on a
ballistic trajectory and broke up during reentry, with some small pieces landing in
the Indian or Paciﬁc Ocean.[13]:III–9–10
Early missions used two ﬁrings of the OMS to achieve orbit; the ﬁrst ﬁring raised the
apogee while the second circularized the orbit. Missions after STS-38 used the RS-25
engines to achieve the optimal apogee, and used the OMS engines to circularize the
orbit. The orbital altitude and inclination were mission-dependent, and the Space
Shuttle's orbits varied from 220 km (120 nmi) to 620 km (335 nmi).[13]:III–10

In orbit

The type of mission that the Space Shuttle was
assigned to dictated the type of orbit that it entered.
The initial design of the reusable Space Shuttle
envisioned an increasingly cheap launch platform to
deploy commercial and government satellites. Early
missions
routinely
ferried
satellites,
which
determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle
would enter. Following the Challenger disaster, many
commercial payloads were moved to expendable
commercial rockets, such as the Delta II.[13]:III–108, 123
While later missions still launched commercial
payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely
directed towards scientiﬁc payloads, such as the
Hubble
Space
Telescope,[13]:III–148
Spacelab,[17]:434–435
and
the
Galileo
[13]:III–140
spacecraft.
Beginning with STS-74, the
orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with the Mir
space station.[13]:III–224 In its ﬁnal decade of
Endeavour docked at ISS during
operation, the Space Shuttle was used for the
the STS-134 mission
construction
of
the
International
Space
Station.[13]:III–264 Most missions involved staying in
orbit several days to two weeks, although longer
missions were possible with the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet.[13]:III–86 The 17
day 15 hour STS-80 mission was the longest Space Shuttle mission
duration.[13]:III–238

Re-entry and landing
Approximately four hours prior to deorbit, the crew
began preparing the orbiter vehicle for reentry by
closing the payload doors, radiating excess heat, and
retracting the Ku-band antenna. The orbiter vehicle
maneuvered to an upside down, tail ﬁrst orientation
and began a 2-4 minute OMS burn approximately 20
minutes before it reenter the atmosphere. The orbiter
vehicle reoriented itself to a nose-forward position
with a 40° angle-of-attack, and the forward RCS jets
were emptied of fuel and disabled prior to reentry.
The orbiter vehicle's reentry was deﬁned as starting
at an altitude 120 km (400,000 ft), when it was
traveling approximately Mach 25. The orbiter
vehicle's reentry was controlled by the GPCs, which
followed a preset angle-of-attack plan to prevent
unsafe heating of the TPS. The GPCs also controlled
the multiple aerobraking S-turns, using only the roll
axis, to dissipate excess speed without changing the
angle-of-attack.[13]:III–12 The orbiter vehicle's aft RCS
jets were disabled as it descended and its ailerons,
elevators, and rudder became eﬀective in the lower
atmosphere. At an altitude of 46 km (150,000 ft), the
orbiter vehicle opened its speed brake on the vertical

stabilizer. At 8 minutes 44 seconds prior to landing, the crew deployed the air data
probes, and began lowering the angle-of-attack to 36°.[13]:III–12 The orbiter's
maximum glide ratio/lift-to-drag ratio varied considerably with speed, ranging from
1.3 at hypersonic speeds to 4.9 at subsonic speeds.[13]:II–1 The orbiter vehicle ﬂew to
one of the two Heading Alignment Cones, located 48 km (30 mi) away from each end
of the runway's centerline, where it made its ﬁnal turns to dissipate excess energy
prior to its approach and landing. Once the orbiter vehicle was traveling
subsonically, the crew took over manual control of the ﬂight.[13]:III–13
The approach and landing phase began when the orbiter vehicle was at an altitude of
3,000 m (10,000 ft) and traveling at 150 m/s (300 kn). the orbiter vehicle followed
either a -20° or -18° glideslope and descended at approximately 51 m/s (167 ft/s).
The speed brake was used to keep a continuous speed, and crew initiated a pre-ﬂare
maneuver to a -1.5° glideslope at an altitude of 610 m (2,000 ft). The landing gear
was deployed 10 seconds prior to touchdown, when the orbiter was at an altitude of
91 m (300 ft) and traveling 150 m/s (288 kn). A ﬁnal ﬂare maneuver reduced the
orbiter vehicle's descent rate to 0.9 m/s (3 ft/s), with touchdown occurring at 100–
150 m/s (195–295 kn), depending on the weight of the orbiter vehicle. After the
landing gear touched down, the crew deployed a drag chute out of the vertical
stabilizer, and began wheel braking when the orbiter vehicle was traveling slower
than 72 m/s (140 kn). After wheels stop, the crew deactivated the ﬂight components
and prepared to exit.[13]:III–13
Landing sites
The primary Space Shuttle landing site was the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC,
where 78 of the 133 successful landings occurred. In the event of unfavorable
landing conditions, the Shuttle could delay its landing or land at an alternate
location. The primary alternate was Edwards AFB, which was used for 54
landings.[13]:III–18–20 STS-3 landed at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico
and required extensive post-processing after exposure to the gypsum-rich sand,
some of which was found in Columbia debris after STS-107.[13]:III–28 Landings at
alternate airﬁelds required the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft to transport the orbiter back
to Cape Canaveral.[13]:III–13
In addition to the pre-planned landing airﬁelds, there were 85 agreed-upon
emergency landing sites to be used in diﬀerent abort scenarios, with 58 located in
other countries. The landing locations were chosen based upon political
relationships, favorable weather, a runway at least 2,300 m (7,500 ft) long, and
TACAN or DME equipment. Additionally, as the orbiter vehicle only had UHF radios,
international sites with only VHF radios would have been unable to communicate
directly with the crew. Facilities on the east coast of the US were planned for East
Coast Abort Landings, while several sites in Europe and Africa were planned in the
event of a Transoceanic Abort Landing. The facilities were prepared with equipment
and personnel in the event of an emergency shuttle landing, but were never
used.[13]:III–19

Post-landing processing

After the landing, ground crews approached the
orbiter to conduct safety checks. Teams wearing selfcontained breathing gear tested for presence of
hydrogen, hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine, nitrogen
tetroxide, and ammonia to ensure the landing area
was safe.[38] Air conditioning and Freon lines were
connected to cool the crew and equipment and
dissipate excess heat from reentry.[13]:III-13 A ﬂight
surgeon boarded the orbiter and performed medical
checks of the crew before they disembarked. Once
the orbiter was secured, it was towed to the OPF to
be inspected, repaired, and prepared for the next
mission.[38]

Space Shuttle program
The Space Shuttle ﬂew from April 12, 1981[13]:III–24 until July 21, 2011.[13]:III–398
Throughout the program, the Space Shuttle had 135 missions,[13]:III–398 of which 133
returned safely.[13]:III–80, 304 Throughout its lifetime, the Space Shuttle was used to
conduct scientiﬁc research,[13]:III–188 deploy commercial,[13]:III–66 military,[13]:III–68
and scientiﬁc payloads,[13]:III–148 and was involved in the construction and operation
of Mir[13]:III–216 and the ISS.[13]:III–264 During its tenure, the Space Shuttle served as
the only U.S. vehicle to launch astronauts, of which there was no replacement until
the launch of Crew Dragon Demo-2 on May 30, 2020.[39]

Budget
The overall NASA budget of the Space Shuttle program has been estimated to be
$221 billion (in 2012 dollars).[13]:III−488 The developers of the Space Shuttle
advocated for reusability as a cost-saving measure, which resulted in higher
development costs for presumed lower costs-per-launch. During the design of the
Space Shuttle, the Phase B proposals were not as cheap as the initial Phase A
estimates indicated; Space Shuttle program manager Robert Thompson
acknowledged that reducing cost-per-pound was not the primary objective of the
further design phases, as other technical requirements could not be met with the
reduced costs.[13]:III−489−490 Development estimates made in 1972 projected a perpound cost of payload as low as $1,109 (in 2012) per pound, but the actual payload
costs, not to include the costs for the research and development of the Space
Shuttle, were $37,207 (in 2012) per pound.[13]:III−491 Per-launch costs varied
throughout the program, and were dependent on the rate of ﬂights as well as
research, development, and investigation proceedings throughout the Space Shuttle
program. In 1982, NASA published an estimate of $260 million (in 2012) per ﬂight,
which was based on the prediction of 24 ﬂights per year for a decade. The per-launch
cost from 1995–2002, when the orbiters and ISS were not being constructed and
there was no recovery work following a loss of crew, was $806 million. NASA
published a study in 1999 that concluded that costs were $576 million (in 2012) if
there were seven launches per year. In 2009, NASA determined that the cost of
adding a single launch per year was $252 million (in 2012), which indicated that
much of the Space Shuttle program costs are for year-round personnel and

operations that continued regardless of the launch rate. Accounting for the entire
Space Shuttle program budget, the per-launch cost was $1.642 billion (in
2012).[13]:III−490

Disasters
On January 28, 1986, STS-51-L disintegrated 73 seconds after launch, due to the
failure of the right SRB, killing all seven astronauts on board Challenger. The
disaster was caused by low-temperature impairment of an O-ring, a mission-critical
seal used between segments of the SRB casing. Failure of the O-ring allowed hot
combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the
adjacent ET, leading to a sequence of events which caused the orbiter to
disintegrate.[40]:71 Repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about
the lack of evidence of the O-rings' safety when the temperature was below 53 °F
(12 °C) had been ignored by NASA managers.[40]:148
On February 1, 2003, Columbia disintegrated during re-entry, killing all seven of the
STS-107 crew, because of damage to the carbon-carbon leading edge of the wing
caused during launch. Ground control engineers had made three separate requests
for high-resolution images taken by the Department of Defense that would have
provided an understanding of the extent of the damage, while NASA's chief TPS
engineer requested that astronauts on board Columbia be allowed to leave the
vehicle to inspect the damage. NASA managers intervened to stop the Department of
Defense's imaging of the orbiter and refused the request for the
spacewalk,[13]:III–323[41] and thus the feasibility of scenarios for astronaut repair or
rescue by Atlantis were not considered by NASA management at the time.[42]

Criticism
The partial reusability of the Space Shuttle was one of the primary design
requirements during its initial development.[6]:164 The technical decisions that
dictated the orbiter's return and reuse reduced the per-launch payload capabilities
with the intention of lowering the per-launch costs and resulting in a high-launch
rate. The actual costs of a Space Shuttle launch were higher than initially predicted,
and the Space Shuttle did not ﬂy the intended 24 missions per year as initially
predicted by NASA.[43][13]:III–489–490 The Space Shuttle was originally intended as a
launch vehicle to deploy satellites, which it was primarily used for on the missions
prior to the Challenger disaster. NASA's pricing, which was below cost, was lower
than expendable launch vehicles; the intention was that the high volume of Space
Shuttle missions would compensate for early ﬁnancial losses. The improvement of
expendable launch vehicles and the transition away from commercial payload on the
Space Shuttle resulted in expendable launch vehicles becoming the primary
deployment option for satellites.[13]:III–109–112
The fatal Challenger and Columbia disasters demonstrated the safety risks of the
Space Shuttle that could result in the loss of the crew. The spaceplane design of the
orbiter limited the abort options, as the abort scenarios required the controlled ﬂight
of the orbiter to a runway or to allow the crew to egress individually, rather than the
abort escape options on the Apollo and Soyuz space capsules.[44] Early safety
analyses advertised by NASA engineers and management predicted the chance of a
catastrophic failure resulting in the death of the crew as ranging from 1 in 100

launches to as rare as 1 in 100,000.[45][46] Following the loss of two Space Shuttle
missions, the risks for the initial missions were reevaluated, and the chance of a
catastrophic loss of the vehicle and crew was found to be as high as 1 in 9.[47] NASA
management was criticized after for accepting increased risk to the crew in
exchange for higher mission rates. Both the Challenger and Columbia reports
explained that NASA culture had failed to keep the crew safe by not objectively
evaluating the potential risks of the missions.[46][48]:195-203

Retirement
The Space Shuttle retirement was
announced in January 2004.[13]:III-347
President George W. Bush announced
his Vision for Space Exploration, which
called for the retirement of the Space
Shuttle once it completed construction
of the ISS.[49][50] To ensure the ISS was
properly assembled, the contributing
partners determined the need for 16
remaining assembly missions in March
Atlantis after its ﬁnal landing
2006.[13]:III-349 One additional Hubble
Space Telescope servicing mission was
approved in October 2006.[13]:III-352 Originally, STS-134 was to be the ﬁnal Space
Shuttle mission. However, the Columbia disaster resulted in additional orbiters being
prepared for launch on need in the event of a rescue mission. As Atlantis was
prepared for the ﬁnal launch-on-need mission, the decision was made in September
2010 that it would ﬂy as STS-135 with a four-person crew that could remain at the
ISS in the event of an emergency.[13]:III-355 STS-135 launched on July 8, 2011, and
landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).[13]:III-398 From the
retirement of the Space Shuttle until the launch of Crew Dragon Demo-2 on May 30,
2020, the US launched its astronaut aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft.[51]
Following each orbiter's ﬁnal ﬂight, it was processed to make it safe for display. The
OMS and RCS systems used presented the primary dangers due to their toxic
hypergolic propellant, and most of their components were permanently removed to
prevent any dangerous outgassing.[13]:III-443 Atlantis is on display at the Kennedy
Space Center Visitor Complex,[13]:III-456 Discovery is at the Udvar-Hazy
Center,[13]:III-451 Endeavour is on display at the California Science Center,[13]:III-457
and Enterprise is displayed at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum.[13]:III-464
Components from the orbiters were transferred to the US Air Force, ISS program,
and Russian and Canadian governments. The engines were removed to be used on
the Space Launch System, and spare RS-25 nozzles were attached for display
purposes.[13]:III-445

In popular culture
The Space Shuttle, and ﬁctitious variants, have been featured in numerous movies.
The plot of the 1979 James Bond ﬁlm Moonraker featured a Space Shuttle that was
stolen while loaned to the United Kingdom.[52] The 1986 ﬁlm SpaceCamp portrayed
Atlantis accidentally launching into space with a group of U.S. Space Camp

participants as its crew.[53] The 2013 ﬁlm Gravity features the ﬁctional Space Shuttle
Explorer during STS-157, whose crew are killed or left stranded after it is destroyed
by a shower of high-speed orbital debris.[54] The Space Shuttle has been featured as
a Lego model.[55] The Space Shuttle also appears in ﬂight simulator and space ﬂight
simulator games such as Microsoft Space Simulator,[56] Orbiter,[57] and Space
Shuttle Mission 2007.[58] The U.S. Postal Service has released several postage issues
that depict the Space Shuttle. The ﬁrst such stamps were issued in 1981, and are on
display at the National Postal Museum.[59]

Notes
a. In this case, the number of successes is determined by the number of successful
Space Shuttle missions.
b. STS-1 and STS-2 were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white ﬁreretardant coating on the external tank. Subsequent missions did not use the latex
coating to reduce the mass, and the external tank appeared orange.[8]:48
