Aircraft
An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to ﬂy by
gaining support from the air. It counters the
force of gravity by using either static lift or
by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil,[1] or
in a few cases the downward thrust from jet
engines. Common examples of aircraft
include airplanes, helicopters, airships
(including blimps), gliders, paramotors and
hot air balloons.[2]
The human activity that surrounds aircraft
is called aviation. The science of aviation,
including designing and building aircraft, is
called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are
ﬂown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned
aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled
or self-controlled by onboard computers.
Aircraft may be classiﬁed by diﬀerent
criteria, such as lift type, aircraft
propulsion, usage and others.

The Mil Mi-8 is the most-produced
helicopter in history.

History
Flying model craft and stories of manned ﬂight go back many centuries; however, the
ﬁrst manned ascent — and safe descent — in modern times took place by larger hotair balloons developed in the 18th century. Each of the two World Wars led to great
technical advances. Consequently, the history of aircraft can be divided into ﬁve
eras:
Pioneers of ﬂight, from the earliest experiments to 1914.
First World War, 1914 to 1918.
Aviation between the World Wars, 1918 to 1939.
Second World War, 1939 to 1945.
Postwar era, also called the Jet Age, 1945 to the present day.

Methods of lift
Lighter than air – aerostats

Aerostats use buoyancy to ﬂoat in the air in much the
same way that ships ﬂoat on the water. They are
characterized by one or more large cells or canopies,
ﬁlled with a relatively low-density gas such as helium,
hydrogen, or hot air, which is less dense than the
surrounding air. When the weight of this is added to
the weight of the aircraft structure, it adds up to the
same weight as the air that the craft displaces.
Hot air balloons

Small hot-air balloons, called sky lanterns, were ﬁrst
invented in ancient China prior to the 3rd century BC
and used primarily in cultural celebrations, and were
only the second type of aircraft to ﬂy, the ﬁrst being kites, which were ﬁrst invented
in ancient China over two thousand years ago. (See Han Dynasty)
A balloon was originally any aerostat, while the term
airship was used for large, powered aircraft
designs — usually ﬁxed-wing.[3][4][5][6][7][8] In 1919
Frederick Handley Page was reported as referring to
"ships of the air," with smaller passenger types as "Air
yachts."[9] In the 1930s, large intercontinental ﬂying
boats were also sometimes referred to as "ships of the
air" or "ﬂying-ships".[10][11] — though none had yet
been built. The advent of powered balloons, called
dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a
Airship USS Akron over
great increase in size, began to change the way these
Manhattan in the 1930s
words were used. Huge powered aerostats,
characterized by a rigid outer framework and
separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the Zeppelins
being the largest and most famous. There were still no ﬁxed-wing aircraft or nonrigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so "airship" came to be synonymous
with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the Hindenburg disaster in 1937,
led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a "balloon" is an unpowered aerostat
and an "airship" is a powered one.
A powered, steerable aerostat is called a dirigible. Sometimes this term is applied
only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes dirigible balloon is regarded as the
deﬁnition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles
are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing ﬁns at the
back. These soon became known as blimps. During World War II, this shape was
widely adopted for tethered balloons; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain
on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname blimp was adopted along with
the shape. In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a
blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.

Heavier-than-air – aerodynes
Heavier-than-air aircraft, such as airplanes, must ﬁnd some way to push air or gas
downwards, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the
aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term
aerodyne. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust — aerodynamic lift, and
powered lift in the form of engine thrust.

Aerodynamic lift involving wings is the most common, with ﬁxed-wing aircraft being
kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and rotorcraft by spinning wingshaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings. A wing is a ﬂat, horizontal surface,
usually shaped in cross-section as an aerofoil. To ﬂy, air must ﬂow over the wing and
generate lift. A ﬂexible wing is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often
stretched over a rigid frame. A kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed
of the wind over its wings, which may be ﬂexible or rigid, ﬁxed, or rotary.
With powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust vertically downward. V/STOL
aircraft, such as the Harrier Jump Jet and Lockheed Martin F-35B take oﬀ and land
vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady ﬂight.
A pure rocket is not usually regarded as an aerodyne, because it does not depend on
the air for its lift (and can even ﬂy into space); however, many aerodynamic lift
vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors. Rocket-powered missiles
that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airﬂow over their bodies are a
marginal case.
Fixed-wing
The forerunner of the ﬁxed-wing aircraft is the kite.
Whereas a ﬁxed-wing aircraft relies on its forward
speed to create airﬂow over the wings, a kite is
tethered to the ground and relies on the wind blowing
over its wings to provide lift. Kites were the ﬁrst kind
of aircraft to ﬂy, and were invented in China around
500 BC. Much aerodynamic research was done with
kites before test aircraft, wind tunnels, and computer
modelling programs became available.

largest passenger airliner

The ﬁrst heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled
free-ﬂight were gliders. A glider designed by George Cayley carried out the ﬁrst true
manned, controlled ﬂight in 1853.
The practical, powered, ﬁxed-wing aircraft (the airplane or aeroplane) was invented
by Wilbur and Orville Wright. Besides the method of propulsion, ﬁxed-wing aircraft
are in general characterized by their wing conﬁguration. The most important wing
characteristics are:
Number of wings — monoplane, biplane, etc.
Wing support — Braced or cantilever, rigid, or ﬂexible.
Wing planform — including aspect ratio, angle of sweep, and any variations along
the span (including the important class of delta wings).
Location of the horizontal stabilizer, if any.
Dihedral angle — positive, zero, or negative (anhedral).
A variable geometry aircraft can change its wing conﬁguration during ﬂight.
A ﬂying wing has no fuselage, though it may have small blisters or pods. The
opposite of this is a lifting body, which has no wings, though it may have small
stabilizing and control surfaces.

Wing-in-ground-eﬀect vehicles are not considered aircraft. They "ﬂy" eﬀiciently close
to the surface of the ground or water, like conventional aircraft during takeoﬀ. An
example is the Russian ekranoplan (nicknamed the "Caspian Sea Monster"). Manpowered aircraft also rely on ground eﬀect to remain airborne with a minimal pilot
power, but this is only because they are so underpowered—in fact, the airframe is
capable of ﬂying higher.
Rotorcraft
Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a spinning
rotor with aerofoil section blades (a rotary wing) to
provide lift. Types include helicopters, autogyros, and
various hybrids such as gyrodynes and compound
rotorcraft.

Helicopters have a rotor turned by an engine-driven
shaft. The rotor pushes air downward to create lift.
By tilting the rotor forward, the downward ﬂow is
tilted backward, producing thrust for forward ﬂight.
Some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few
have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips.
Autogyros have unpowered rotors, with a separate
power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted
backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows
upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning
increases the speed of airﬂow over the rotor, to
provide lift. Rotor kites are unpowered autogyros,
which are towed to give them forward speed or
tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited
ﬂight.

Cyclogyros rotate their wings about a horizontal axis.
Compound rotorcraft have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward ﬂight.
They are nowadays classiﬁed as powered lift types and not as rotorcraft. Tiltrotor
aircraft (such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey), tiltwing, tail-sitter, and coleopter
aircraft have their rotors/propellers horizontal for vertical ﬂight and vertical for
forward ﬂight.
Other methods of lift
A lifting body is an aircraft body shaped to produce lift. If there are any wings, they
are too small to provide signiﬁcant lift and are used only for stability and control.
Lifting bodies are not eﬃcient: they suﬀer from high drag, and must also travel at
high speed to generate enough lift to ﬂy. Many of the research prototypes, such as
the Martin Marietta X-24, which led up to the Space Shuttle, were lifting bodies,
though the Space Shuttle is not, and some supersonic missiles obtain lift from the
airﬂow over a tubular body.
Powered lift types rely on engine-derived lift for vertical takeoﬀ and landing (VTOL).
Most types transition to ﬁxed-wing lift for horizontal ﬂight. Classes of powered lift
types include VTOL jet aircraft (such as the Harrier Jump Jet) and tiltrotors, such as

the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, among others. A few
experimental designs rely entirely on engine thrust
to provide lift throughout the whole ﬂight, including
personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks.
VTOL research designs include the Rolls-Royce
Thrust Measuring Rig.
The Flettner airplane uses a rotating cylinder in
place of a ﬁxed wing, obtaining lift from the
Magnus eﬀect.
The ornithopter obtains thrust by ﬂapping its wings.

Sizes

The smallest aircraft are toys/recreational items, and even smaller, nano-aircraft.
The largest aircraft by dimensions and volume (as of 2016) is the 302-foot-long
(about 95 meters) British Airlander 10, a hybrid blimp, with helicopter and ﬁxedwing features, and reportedly capable of speeds up to 90 mph (about 150 km/h), and
an airborne endurance of two weeks with a payload of up to 22,050 pounds (11
tons).[12][13][14]
The largest aircraft by weight and largest regular ﬁxed-wing aircraft ever built, as of
2016, is the Antonov An-225 Mriya. That Ukrainian-built six-engine Russian transport
of the 1980s is 84 meters (276 feet) long, with an 88-meter (289-foot) wingspan. It
holds the world payload record, after transporting 428,834 pounds (200 tons) of
goods, and has recently ﬂown 100-ton loads commercially. Weighing in between 1.1
and 1.4 million pounds (550–700 tons) maximum loaded weight, it is also the
heaviest aircraft built to date. It can cruise at 500 mph.[15][16][17][18][19]
The largest military airplanes are the Ukrainian/Russian Antonov An-124 Ruslan
(world's second-largest airplane, also used as a civilian transport),[20] and American
Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport, weighing, loaded, over 765,000 pounds (over 380
tons).[19][21] The 8-engine, piston/propeller Hughes H-4 Hercules "Spruce Goose" —
an American World War II wooden ﬂying boat transport with a greater wingspan (94
meters / 260 feet) than any current aircraft and a tail height equal to the tallest
(Airbus A380-800 at 24.1 meters / 78 feet) — ﬂew only one short hop in the late
1940s and never ﬂew out of ground eﬀect.[19]
The largest civilian airplanes, apart from the above-noted An-225 and An-124, are
the Airbus Beluga cargo transport derivative of the Airbus A300 jet airliner, the
Boeing Dreamlifter cargo transport derivative of the Boeing 747 jet airliner/transport
(the 747-200B was, at its creation in the 1960s, the heaviest aircraft ever built, with
a maximum weight of 836,000 pounds (over 400 tons)),[21] and the double-decker
Airbus A380 "super-jumbo" jet airliner (the world's largest passenger airliner).[19][22]

Speeds

The fastest recorded powered aircraft ﬂight and fastest recorded aircraft ﬂight of an
air-breathing powered aircraft was of the NASA X-43A Pegasus, a scramjet-powered,
hypersonic, lifting body experimental research aircraft, at Mach 9.6 (nearly
7,000 mph). The X-43A set that new mark, and broke its own world record of Mach
6.3, nearly 5,000 mph, set in March 2004, on its third and ﬁnal ﬂight on 16
November 2004.[23][24]
Prior to the X-43A, the fastest recorded powered airplane ﬂight (and still the record
for the fastest manned, powered airplane / fastest manned, non-spacecraft aircraft)
was of the North American X-15A-2, rocket-powered airplane at 4,520 mph
(7,274 km/h), Mach 6.72, on 3 October 1967. On one ﬂight it reached an altitude of
354,300 feet.[25][26][27]
The fastest known, production aircraft (other than rockets and missiles) currently or
formerly operational (as of 2016) are:
The fastest ﬁxed-wing aircraft, and fastest glider, is the Space Shuttle, a rocketglider hybrid, which has re-entered the atmosphere as a ﬁxed-wing glider at more
than Mach 25 — over 25 times the speed of sound, about 17,000 mph at re-entry
to Earth's atmosphere.[25][28]
The fastest military airplane ever built: Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, a U.S.
reconnaissance jet ﬁxed-wing aircraft, known to ﬂy beyond Mach 3.3 (about
2,200 mph at cruising altitude). On 28 July 1976, an SR-71 set the record for the
fastest and highest-ﬂying operational aircraft with an absolute speed record of
2,193 mph and an absolute altitude record of 85,068 feet. At its retirement in the
January 1990, it was the fastest air-breathing aircraft / fastest jet aircraft in the
world, a record still standing as of August 2016.[25][29][30][31][32][33]
Note: Some sources refer to the above-mentioned X-15 as the "fastest military
airplane" because it was partly a project of the U.S. Navy and Air Force; however,
the X-15 was not used in non-experimental actual military operations.[27]
The fastest current military aircraft are the Soviet/Russian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG25 — capable of Mach 3.2 (2,170 mph), at the expense of engine damage, or Mach
2.83 (1,920 mph) normally — and the Russian Mikoyan MiG-31E (also capable of
Mach 2.83 normally). Both are ﬁghter-interceptor jet airplanes, in active operations
as of 2016.[34][35][36]
The fastest civilian airplane ever built, and fastest passenger airliner ever built: the
brieﬂy operated Tupolev Tu-144 supersonic jet airliner (Mach 2.35, 1,600 mph,
2,587 km/h), which was believed to cruise at about Mach 2.2. The Tu-144 (oﬃcially
operated from 1968 to 1978, ending after two crashes of the small ﬂeet) was
outlived by its rival, the Concorde (Mach 2.23), a French/British supersonic airliner,
known to cruise at Mach 2.02 (1.450 mph, 2,333 kmh at cruising altitude),
operating from 1976 until the small Concorde ﬂeet was grounded permanently in
2003, following the crash of one in the early 2000s.[25][27][37][38]
The fastest civilian airplane currently ﬂying: the Cessna Citation X, an American
business jet, capable of Mach 0.935 (over 600 mph at cruising altitude). Its rival,
the American Gulfstream G650 business jet, can reach Mach 0.925[25][27][39][40]
The fastest airliner currently ﬂying is the Boeing 747, quoted as being capable of
cruising over Mach 0.885 (over 550 mph). Previously, the fastest were the
troubled, short-lived Russian (Soviet Union) Tupolev Tu-144 SST (Mach 2.35) and

the French/British Concorde (Mach 2.23, normally cruising at Mach 2) .[25][37][38]
Before them, the Convair 990 Coronado jet airliner of the 1960s ﬂew at over
600 mph.

Propulsion
Unpowered aircraft
Gliders are heavier-than-air aircraft that do not employ propulsion once airborne.
Take-oﬀ may be by launching forward and downward from a high location, or by
pulling into the air on a tow-line, either by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a
powered "tug" aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must
descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Many
gliders can "soar", i.e., gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. The ﬁrst
practical, controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and
pioneer George Cayley, whom many recognise as the ﬁrst aeronautical engineer.
Common examples of gliders are sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders.
Balloons drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude,
either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control
(since the wind direction changes with altitude). A wing-shaped hybrid balloon can
glide directionally when rising or falling; but a spherically shaped balloon does not
have such directional control.
Kites are aircraft[41] that are tethered to the ground or other object (ﬁxed or mobile)
that maintains tension in the tether or kite line; they rely on virtual or real wind
blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag. Kytoons are balloon-kite
hybrids that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deﬂections, and can be lighterthan-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than-air.

Powered aircraft
Powered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power, typically
aircraft engines although rubber and manpower have also been used. Most aircraft
engines are either lightweight reciprocating engines or gas turbines. Engine fuel is
stored in tanks, usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional fuel
tanks in the fuselage.
Propeller aircraft
Propeller aircraft use one or more propellers (airscrews) to create thrust in a
forward direction. The propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in
tractor conﬁguration but can be mounted behind in pusher conﬁguration. Variations
of propeller layout include contra-rotating propellers and ducted fans.
Many kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers. Early airships used
man power or steam engines. The more practical internal combustion piston engine
was used for virtually all ﬁxed-wing aircraft until World War II and is still used in
many smaller aircraft. Some types use turbine engines to drive a propeller in the
form of a turboprop or propfan. Human-powered ﬂight has been achieved, but has

not become a practical means of transport.
Unmanned aircraft and models have also used power
sources such as electric motors and rubber bands.
Jet aircraft
Jet aircraft use airbreathing jet engines, which take in
air, burn fuel with it in a combustion chamber, and
accelerate the exhaust rearwards to provide thrust.
Diﬀerent jet engine conﬁgurations include the
turbojet and turbofan, sometimes with the addition of
an
afterburner.
Those
with
no
rotating
turbomachinery include the pulsejet and ramjet.
These mechanically simple engines produce no thrust
when stationary, so the aircraft must be launched to
ﬂying speed using a catapult, like the V-1 ﬂying bomb,
or a rocket, for example. Other engine types include
the motorjet and the dual-cycle Pratt & Whitney J58.

Compared to engines using propellers, jet engines
can provide much higher thrust, higher speeds and,
Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor
above about 40,000 ft (12,000 m), greater
eﬀiciency.[42] They are also much more fuel-eﬀicient
than rockets. As a consequence nearly all large, high-speed or high-altitude aircraft
use jet engines.
Rotorcraft
Some rotorcraft, such as helicopters, have a powered rotary wing or rotor, where the
rotor disc can be angled slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed
forwards. The rotor may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as
a piston engine or turbine. Experiments have also used jet nozzles at the rotor blade
tips.
Other types of powered aircraft

Rocket-powered aircraft have occasionally been experimented with, and the
Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet ﬁghter even saw action in the Second World War.
Since then, they have been restricted to research aircraft, such as the North
American X-15, which traveled up into space where air-breathing engines cannot
work (rockets carry their own oxidant). Rockets have more often been used as a
supplement to the main power plant, typically for the rocket-assisted take oﬀ of
heavily loaded aircraft, but also to provide high-speed dash capability in some
hybrid designs such as the Saunders-Roe SR.53.
The ornithopter obtains thrust by ﬂapping its wings. It has found practical use in a
model hawk used to freeze prey animals into stillness so that they can be
captured, and in toy birds.

Design and construction

Aircraft are designed according to many factors such as customer and manufacturer
demand, safety protocols and physical and economic constraints. For many types of
aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities.
The key parts of an aircraft are generally divided into three categories:
The structure comprises the main load-bearing elements and associated
equipment.
The propulsion system (if it is powered) comprises the power source and
associated equipment, as described above.
The avionics comprise the control, navigation and communication systems, usually
electrical in nature.

Structure
The approach to structural design varies widely between diﬀerent types of aircraft.
Some, such as paragliders, comprise only ﬂexible materials that act in tension and
rely on aerodynamic pressure to hold their shape. A balloon similarly relies on
internal gas pressure, but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry
its payload. Early aircraft, including airships, often employed ﬂexible doped aircraft
fabric covering to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame.
Later aircraft employed semi-monocoque techniques, where the skin of the aircraft is
stiﬀ enough to share much of the ﬂight loads. In a true monocoque design there is no
internal structure left.
The key structural parts of an aircraft depend on what type it is.
Aerostats
Lighter-than-air types are characterised by one or more gasbags, typically with a
supporting structure of ﬂexible cables or a rigid framework called its hull. Other
elements such as engines or a gondola may also be attached to the supporting
structure.
Aerodynes
Heavier-than-air types are characterised by one or
more wings and a central fuselage. The fuselage
typically also carries a tail or empennage for stability
and control, and an undercarriage for takeoﬀ and
landing. Engines may be located on the fuselage or
wings. On a ﬁxed-wing aircraft the wings are rigidly
attached to the fuselage, while on a rotorcraft the
wings are attached to a rotating vertical shaft.
Smaller designs sometimes use ﬂexible materials for
part or all of the structure, held in place either by a
rigid frame or by air pressure. The ﬁxed parts of the
structure comprise the airframe.

Avionics
The avionics comprise the aircraft ﬂight control systems and related equipment,
including the cockpit instrumentation, navigation, radar, monitoring, and
communications systems.

Flight characteristics
Flight envelope
The ﬂight envelope of an aircraft refers to its approved design capabilities in terms
of airspeed, load factor and altitude.[43][44] The term can also refer to other
assessments of aircraft performance such as maneuverability. When an aircraft is
abused, for instance by diving it at too-high a speed, it is said to be ﬂown outside the
envelope, something considered foolhardy since it has been taken beyond the design
limits which have been established by the manufacturer. Going beyond the envelope
may have a known outcome such as ﬂutter or entry to a non-recoverable spin
(possible reasons for the boundary).

Range
The range is the distance an aircraft can ﬂy between
takeoﬀ and landing, as limited by the time it can
remain airborne.
For a powered aircraft the time limit is determined by
the fuel load and rate of consumption.
For an unpowered aircraft, the maximum ﬂight time
is limited by factors such as weather conditions and
pilot endurance. Many aircraft types are restricted to
daylight hours, while balloons are limited by their
supply of lifting gas. The range can be seen as the
average ground speed multiplied by the maximum
time in the air.

The Boeing 777-200LR is one of
the longest-range airliners,
capable of ﬂights of more than
halfway around the world.

The Airbus A350 is now the longest range airliner.

Flight dynamics
Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and
control in three dimensions. The three critical ﬂight
dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation around
three axes which pass through the vehicle's center of
gravity, known as pitch, roll, and yaw.
Roll is a rotation about the longitudinal axis (equivalent
to the rolling or heeling of a ship) giving an up-down
movement of the wing tips measured by the roll or bank angle.

Pitch is a rotation about the sideways horizontal axis giving an up-down movement
of the aircraft nose measured by the angle of attack.
Yaw is a rotation about the vertical axis giving a side-to-side movement of the nose
known as sideslip.
Flight dynamics is concerned with the stability and control of an aircraft's rotation
about each of these axes.
Stability
An aircraft that is unstable tends to diverge from its
intended ﬂight path and so is diﬀicult to ﬂy. A very
stable aircraft tends to stay on its ﬂight path and is
diﬀicult to maneuver. Therefore, it is important for
any design to achieve the desired degree of stability.
Since the widespread use of digital computers, it is
increasingly common for designs to be inherently
unstable and rely on computerised control systems to
provide artiﬁcial stability.

The empennage of a Boeing
747-200

A ﬁxed wing is typically unstable in pitch, roll, and
yaw. Pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional ﬁxed
wing designs require horizontal and vertical
stabilisers,[45][46] which act similarly to the feathers on an arrow.[47] These
stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the
ﬂight dynamics of pitch and yaw.[45][46] They are usually mounted on the tail section
(empennage), although in the canard layout, the main aft wing replaces the canard
foreplane as pitch stabilizer. Tandem wing and tailless aircraft rely on the same
general rule to achieve stability, the aft surface being the stabilising one.
A rotary wing is typically unstable in yaw, requiring a vertical stabiliser.
A balloon is typically very stable in pitch and roll due to the way the payload is slung
underneath the center of lift.
Control
Flight control surfaces enable the pilot to control an aircraft's ﬂight attitude and are
usually part of the wing or mounted on, or integral with, the associated stabilizing
surface. Their development was a critical advance in the history of aircraft, which
had until that point been uncontrollable in ﬂight.
Aerospace engineers develop control systems for a vehicle's orientation (attitude)
about its center of mass. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in
various directions, and generate rotational forces or moments about the
aerodynamic center of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw.
For example, a pitching moment is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or
aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or
down. Control systems are also sometimes used to increase or decrease drag, for
example to slow the aircraft to a safe speed for landing.

The two main aerodynamic forces acting on any aircraft are lift supporting it in the
air and drag opposing its motion. Control surfaces or other techniques may also be
used to aﬀect these forces directly, without inducing any rotation.

Impacts of aircraft use
Aircraft permit long distance, high speed travel and may be a more fuel eﬀicient
mode of transportation in some circumstances. Aircraft have environmental and
climate impacts beyond fuel eﬀiciency considerations, however. They are also
relatively noisy compared to other forms of travel and high altitude aircraft generate
contrails, which experimental evidence suggests may alter weather patterns.

Uses for aircraft
Aircraft are produced in several diﬀerent types optimized for various uses; military
aircraft, which includes not just combat types but many types of supporting aircraft,
and civil aircraft, which include all non-military types, experimental and model.

Military
A military aircraft is any aircraft that is operated by a
legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type.[48]
Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:
Combat aircraft are aircraft designed to destroy
enemy equipment using its own armament.[48]
Combat aircraft divide broadly into ﬁghters and
bombers, with several in-between types, such as
Boeing B-17E in ﬂight
ﬁghter-bombers and attack aircraft, including
attack helicopters.
Non-combat aircraft are not designed for combat as their primary function, but
may carry weapons for self-defense. Non-combat roles include search and rescue,
reconnaissance, observation, transport, training, and aerial refueling. These
aircraft are often variants of civil aircraft.
Most military aircraft are powered heavier-than-air types. Other types, such as
gliders and balloons, have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons
were used for observation during the American Civil War and World War I, and
military gliders were used during World War II to land troops.

Civil
Civil aircraft divide into commercial and general types, however there are some
overlaps.
Commercial aircraft include types designed for scheduled and charter airline ﬂights,
carrying passengers, mail and other cargo. The larger passenger-carrying types are
the airliners, the largest of which are wide-body aircraft. Some of the smaller types
are also used in general aviation, and some of the larger types are used as VIP

aircraft.
General aviation is a catch-all covering other kinds of
private (where the pilot is not paid for time or
expenses) and commercial use, and involving a wide
range of aircraft types such as business jets (bizjets),
trainers, homebuilt, gliders, warbirds and hot air
balloons to name a few. The vast majority of aircraft
today are general aviation types.

Experimental
An experimental aircraft is one that has not been fully proven in ﬂight, or that carries
a Special Airworthiness Certiﬁcate, called an Experimental Certiﬁcate in United
States parlance. This often implies that the aircraft is testing new aerospace
technologies, though the term also refers to amateur-built and kit-built aircraft,
many of which are based on proven designs.

Model
A model aircraft is a small unmanned type made to ﬂy
for fun, for static display, for aerodynamic research or
for other purposes. A scale model is a replica of some
larger design.
