SATURN, APPROACHING NORTHERN
SUMMER

Did You Know?
Twice every 29 and a half years the great planet Saturn appears
ringless.
This is an optical illusion:
Earthlings cannot see Saturn's rings when the rings are edge-on
as viewed from the Earth. They are barely visible through
powerful telescopes.

Pop Culture

Perhaps the most iconic of all the planets in our solar
system, Saturn is heavily present in pop culture.
It provides a backdrop for numerous science fiction
stories, movies and TV shows, comics, and video
games, including the Cthulhu Mythos, WALL-E, 2001:

A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, Dead Space 2 and Final
Fantasy VII. In Tim Burton's film Beetlejuice, a dusty,
fictional Saturn is populated by giant sandworms.
And in the 2014 movie Interstellar, the wormhole that
enables the astronauts to travel to another galaxy
appears near Saturn.
Saturn is also the namesake of Saturday, arguably
the best day of the week.

In one of nature's most dramatic examples
of "now-you see-them, now-you-don't,"

Kid-Friendly Saturn
Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely
has the most beautiful ones.
The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that
surround Saturn. They’re made of chunks of ice and rock.
Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and
helium.
