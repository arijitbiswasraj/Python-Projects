Jupiter
Twice as massive as all the other planets combined

Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists—all the way back
to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth.
That discovery changed the way we see the universe.

Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the
largest planet in the solar system – more than twice

Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold,
windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an
atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic
Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth
that has raged for hundreds of years.
One spacecraft — NASA's Juno orbiter — is currently exploring
this giant world.

GREAT RED SPOT

Did You Know?
There are no rockets powerful enough to hurl a spacecraft into
the outer solar system and beyond. In 1962, scientists calculated
how to use Jupiter's intense gravity to hurl spacecraft into the
farthest regions of the solar system. We've been traveling farther
and faster ever since.

Pop Culture
The biggest planet in our solar system, Jupiter also has a large
presence in pop culture, including many movies, TV shows, video
games and comics. Jupiter was a notable destination in the
Wachowski siblings’ science fiction spectacle Jupiter Ascending,

while various Jovian moons provide settings for Cloud Atlas,

Futurama, Power Rangers, and Halo, among many others. In Men
in Black when Agent J—played by Will Smith—mentions he
thought one of his childhood teachers was from Venus, Agent K—
played by Tommy Lee Jones—replies that she is actually from
one of Jupiter’s moons.

Kid-Friendly Jupiter
Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's
similar to a star, but it never got big enough to start
burning.
Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big
storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for
hundreds of years.
Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface,
but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth.
Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very
well.

Build Your Own 3D Glasses
With a few materials and a few
steps, you can build your own
glasses to view 3D images.

Make Your Own 3D Images

Galileo was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter.

You can create your own red/blue
