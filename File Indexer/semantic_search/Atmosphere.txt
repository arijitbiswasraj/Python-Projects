Atmosphere
An atmosphere (from Ancient Greek ἀτμός
(atmos), meaning 'vapour', and σφαῖρα
(sphaira), meaning 'ball' or 'sphere'[1][2]) is a
layer or a set of layers of gases surrounding a
planet or other material body, that is held in
place by the gravity of that body. An
atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the
gravity it is subject to is high and the
temperature of the atmosphere is low.
The atmosphere of Earth is composed of
nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%),
argon (about 0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%)
and other gases in trace amounts.[3] Oxygen is
used by most organisms for respiration;
nitrogen is ﬁxed by bacteria and lightning to
produce ammonia used in the construction of
nucleotides and amino acids; and carbon
Mars's thin atmosphere
dioxide is used by plants, algae and
cyanobacteria
for
photosynthesis.
The
atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by solar
ultraviolet radiation, solar wind and cosmic rays. The current composition of the
Earth's atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical modiﬁcation of
the paleoatmosphere by living organisms.
The term stellar atmosphere describes the outer region of a star and typically
includes the portion above the opaque photosphere. Stars with suﬀiciently low
temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound molecules.

Pressure
Atmospheric pressure at a particular location is the force
per unit area perpendicular to a surface determined by the
weight of the vertical column of atmosphere above that
location. On Earth, units of air pressure are based on the
internationally recognized standard atmosphere (atm),
which is deﬁned as 101.325 kPa (760 Torr or 14.696 psi). It
is measured with a barometer.
Atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude
due to the diminishing mass of gas above. The height at
which the pressure from an atmosphere declines by a factor
of e (an irrational number with a value of 2.71828...) is
called the scale height and is denoted by H. For an
atmosphere with a uniform temperature, the scale height is
proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional
to the product of the mean molecular mass of dry air and
the local acceleration of gravity at that location. For such a
model atmosphere, the pressure declines exponentially with
increasing altitude. However, atmospheres are not uniform
in temperature, so estimation of the atmospheric pressure
at any particular altitude is more complex.

Atmospheric escape
Surface gravity diﬀers signiﬁcantly among the planets. For
example, the large gravitational force of the giant planet
Jupiter retains light gases such as hydrogen and helium that
escape from objects with lower gravity. Secondly, the
distance from the Sun determines the energy available to
heat atmospheric gas to the point where some fraction of its
molecules' thermal motion exceed the planet's escape
velocity, allowing those to escape a planet's gravitational
grasp. Thus, distant and cold Titan, Triton, and Pluto are
able to retain their atmospheres despite their relatively low
gravities.
Since a collection of gas molecules may be moving at a wide
range of velocities, there will always be some fast enough to
produce a slow leakage of gas into space. Lighter molecules
move faster than heavier ones with the same thermal
kinetic energy, and so gases of low molecular weight are
lost more rapidly than those of high molecular weight. It is

thought that Venus and Mars may have lost much of their
The layers of Earth's
water when, after being photodissociated into hydrogen and
atmosphere
oxygen by solar ultraviolet radiation, the hydrogen escaped.
Earth's magnetic ﬁeld helps to prevent this, as, normally,
the solar wind would greatly enhance the escape of
hydrogen. However, over the past 3 billion years Earth may have lost gases through
the magnetic polar regions due to auroral activity, including a net 2% of its
atmospheric oxygen.[4] The net eﬀect, taking the most important escape processes
into account, is that an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld does not protect a planet from
atmospheric escape and that for some magnetizations the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld works to increase the escape rate.[5]
Other mechanisms that can cause atmosphere depletion are solar wind-induced
sputtering, impact erosion, weathering, and sequestration—sometimes referred to as
"freezing out"—into the regolith and polar caps.

Terrain
Atmospheres have dramatic eﬀects on the surfaces of rocky bodies. Objects that
have no atmosphere, or that have only an exosphere, have terrain that is covered in
craters. Without an atmosphere, the planet has no protection from meteoroids, and
all of them collide with the surface as meteorites and create craters.
Most meteoroids burn up as meteors before hitting a planet's surface. When
meteoroids do impact, the eﬀects are often erased by the action of wind.[6] As a
result, craters are rare on objects with atmospheres.
Wind erosion is a signiﬁcant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets with
atmospheres, and over time can erase the eﬀects of both craters and volcanoes. In
addition, since liquids can not exist without pressure, an atmosphere allows liquid to
be present at the surface, resulting in lakes, rivers and oceans. Earth and Titan are
known to have liquids at their surface and terrain on the planet suggests that Mars
had liquid on its surface in the past.

Composition
A planet's initial atmospheric composition is related
to the chemistry and temperature of the local solar
nebula
during
planetary
formation
and
the
subsequent escape of interior gases. The original
atmospheres started with a rotating disc of gases that
collapsed to form a series of spaced rings that
condensed to form the planets. The planet's
atmospheres were then modiﬁed over time by various
complex factors, resulting in quite diﬀerent outcomes.
The atmospheres of the planets Venus and Mars are
primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with small
quantities of nitrogen, argon, oxygen and traces of
other gases.[7]

The composition of Earth's atmosphere is largely governed by the by-products of the
life that it sustains. Dry air from Earth's atmosphere contains 78.08% nitrogen,
20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and traces of hydrogen, helium,
and other "noble" gases (by volume), but generally a variable amount of water vapor
is also present, on average about 1% at sea level.[8]
The low temperatures and higher gravity of the Solar System's giant planets—
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—allow them more readily to retain gases with
low molecular masses. These planets have hydrogen–helium atmospheres, with trace
amounts of more complex compounds.
Two satellites of the outer planets possess signiﬁcant atmospheres. Titan, a moon of
Saturn, and Triton, a moon of Neptune, have atmospheres mainly of nitrogen. When
in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, Pluto has an atmosphere of nitrogen and
methane similar to Triton's, but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the
Sun.
Other bodies within the Solar System have extremely thin atmospheres not in
equilibrium. These include the Moon (sodium gas), Mercury (sodium gas), Europa
(oxygen), Io (sulfur), and Enceladus (water vapor).
The ﬁrst exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is HD 209458b,
a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the constellation Pegasus. Its
atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000 K, and is steadily escaping into
space. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and sulfur have been detected in the planet's
inﬂated atmosphere.[9]

Structure
Earth's atmosphere
Earth's atmosphere consists of a number of layers that diﬀer in properties such as
composition, temperature and pressure. The lowest layer is the troposphere, which
extends from the surface to the bottom of the stratosphere. Three quarters of the
atmosphere's mass resides within the troposphere, and is the layer within which the
Earth's terrestrial weather develops. The depth of this layer varies between 17 km at
the equator to 7 km at the poles. The stratosphere, extending from the top of the
troposphere to the bottom of the mesosphere, contains the ozone layer. The ozone
layer ranges in altitude between 15 and 35 km, and is where most of the ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun is absorbed. The top of the mesosphere, ranges from 50 to
85 km, and is the layer wherein most meteors burn up. The thermosphere extends
from 85 km to the base of the exosphere at 400 km and contains the ionosphere, a
region where the atmosphere is ionized by incoming solar radiation. The ionosphere
increases in thickness and moves closer to the Earth during daylight and rises at
night allowing certain frequencies of radio communication over a greater range. The
Kármán line, located within the thermosphere at an altitude of 100 km, is commonly
used to deﬁne the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space. The
exosphere begins variously from about 690 to 1,000 km above the surface, where it
interacts with the planet's magnetosphere. Each of the layers has a diﬀerent lapse
rate, deﬁning the rate of change in temperature with height.

Circulation
The circulation of the atmosphere occurs due to thermal diﬀerences when convection
becomes a more eﬀicient transporter of heat than thermal radiation. On planets
where the primary heat source is solar radiation, excess heat in the tropics is
transported to higher latitudes. When a planet generates a signiﬁcant amount of heat
internally, such as is the case for Jupiter, convection in the atmosphere can transport
thermal energy from the higher temperature interior up to the surface.

Importance

From the perspective of a planetary geologist, the atmosphere acts to shape a
planetary surface. Wind picks up dust and other particles which, when they collide
with the terrain, erode the relief and leave deposits (eolian processes). Frost and
precipitations, which depend on the atmospheric composition, also inﬂuence the
relief. Climate changes can inﬂuence a planet's geological history. Conversely,
studying the surface of the Earth leads to an understanding of the atmosphere and
climate of other planets.
For a meteorologist, the composition of the Earth's atmosphere is a factor aﬀecting
the climate and its variations.
For a biologist or paleontologist, the Earth's atmospheric composition is closely
dependent on the appearance of the life and its evolution.
