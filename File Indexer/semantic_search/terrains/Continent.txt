Continent
A continent is one of several very large landmasses. Generally
identiﬁed by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to
seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered
from largest in area to smallest, these seven regions are: Asia,
Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and
Australia.[1] Variations with fewer continents may merge some
of these, for example some systems include Eurasia or America
as single continents.
Geologically, the continents correspond to areas of continental
crust that are found on the continental plates, but include
continental fragments such as Madagascar that are not
commonly referred to as continents. Some geological
continents are largely covered with water, such as Zealandia
(see submerged continents below). Continental crust is only
known to exist on Earth.[2]

continents. Depending on the convention and
model, some continents may be consolidated or
subdivided: for example, Eurasia is most often
subdivided into Asia and Europe (red shades),
while North and South America are sometimes
recognised as one American continent (green
shades).

Oceanic islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring
continent to divide all the world's land into regions. Under this
scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the
Paciﬁc Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a region called Oceania.

Deﬁnitions and application
By convention, "continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated
by expanses of water."[3] In modern schemes with ﬁve or more recognised continents, at least one pair of
continents is joined by land in some way. The criterion "large" leads to arbitrary classiﬁcation: Greenland, with

a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330 sq mi) is considered the world's largest island, while
Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi) is deemed the smallest continent.
Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number
of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.[4][5]

Extent
The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[6] area of land or mainland, with the coastline
and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe
(sometimes referred to in Britain as "the Continent") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands
such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the
mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to
the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the
northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii in the Paciﬁc Ocean.
From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the conﬁnes of
continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[7] and the islands
on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[8]
From this perspective, the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary
with changes in sea level.[9] In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while
Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.
As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond
the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental
fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and
Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its
extreme, some geographers group the Australian continental plate
with other islands in the Paciﬁc into one "quasi-continent" called
Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into
continents or quasi-continents.[10]

Separation

Map of island countries: these states are often
grouped geographically with a neighbouring
continental landmass.

The ideal criterion that each continent is a discrete landmass is
commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven
most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia
are completely separated from other continents by the ocean. Several continents are deﬁned not as absolutely
distinct bodies but as "more or less discrete masses of land".[11] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of
Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation
of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and
shallow, as well as man-made). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses
they unite.
North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However,
they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America. This viewpoint was common in the United
States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[12] This remains the more
common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Germany, Greece and Hungary,
where they are taught as a single continent.
The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is
classiﬁed as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are
peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively
large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), while South Asia, with less than half that
area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single
continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as
a residue of Eurocentrism: "In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the
entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...]."[13] However, for historical and cultural
reasons, the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.
If continents are deﬁned strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then
Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia.[14] Combined with
the consolidation of the Americas, this would produce a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia,
America, Antarctica and Australia.

When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as
dry land, forming land bridges. At those times Australia–New Guinea was a single, continuous continent.
Likewise, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great
Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents:
Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.

The seven-continent model is usually taught in most English-speaking countries including the United States,
United Kingdom[35] and Australia,[36] and also in China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and parts of Western
Europe.
The six-continent combined-Eurasia model is mostly used in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Japan.
The six-continent combined-America model is often used in Latin America,[37] Greece,[27] and countries that
speak Romance languages.
A ﬁve-continent model is obtained from the combined-America model by excluding Antarctica as uninhabited.
This is used in the United Nations[38] and in the Olympic Charter[39] in its description of the Olympic ﬂag.
As previously mentioned, some geographers use the name Oceania for a region including most of the island
countries and territories in the Paciﬁc Ocean as well as the continent of Australia.

Other divisions
Supercontinents
Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies.
Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than
one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia,
Rodinia, and Pangaea. Over time, these supercontinents broke apart into large land masses which caused the
formation of the present continents.

Subcontinents
Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from
the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian
subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.[43] The Southern Cone of South America and the Alaska Peninsula of
North America are other examples.[43]
In many of these cases, the "subcontinents" concerned are on diﬀerent tectonic plates from the rest of the
continent, providing a geological justiﬁcation for the terminology.[44] Greenland, generally reckoned as the
world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a
subcontinent.[45][46] This is a signiﬁcant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as
comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.
Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North
America and South America)[47][48][49] or three (with Central America being the third).[50][51] When Eurasia is
regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.[43]

Submerged continents
Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents.
Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the
almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.

Microcontinents
Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental
landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered
microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa, but its divergent

evolution has caused it to be referred to as "the eighth continent" from a biological perspective.[52]

Botanical continents
"Continents" may be deﬁned diﬀerently for speciﬁc purposes. The
Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the
World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used
in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world
into nine "botanical continents". Some match the traditional
geographical continents, but some diﬀer signiﬁcantly. Thus the
Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico
northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the
Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and
South America.[53]

History of the concept
Early concepts of the Old World continents

The Ancient Greek
geographer Strabo
holding a globe showing
Europa and Asia

The term "continent" translates Greek ἤπειρος, properly "landmass, terra ﬁrma", the
proper name of Epirus and later especially used of Asia (i.e. Asia Minor),[54] The ﬁrst
distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the
names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean
Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black
Sea.[55] The names were ﬁrst applied just to lands near the coast and only later
extended to include the hinterlands.[56] But the division was only carried through to
the end of navigable waterways and "... beyond that point the Hellenic geographers
never succeeded in laying their ﬁnger on any inland feature in the physical landscape
that could oﬀer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ..."[55]

Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya)
should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three
parts eventually came to predominate.[57] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea
was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.[58] The
boundaries between the continents were not ﬁxed. Early on, the Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from
the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from
the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in
Russia.[59] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus[60] in
the 5th century BC objected to the whole of Egypt being split between Asia and Africa ("Libya") and took the
boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the
division into three of what is really a single landmass,[61] a debate that continues nearly two and a half
millennia later.
Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile
and the Don), thus considering them "islands". Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the
continents "peninsulas". These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus
between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between
the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.[62]
Through the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary
between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt
(Gibbon). In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the
waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, "the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa
at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and Libya] farther west, had even then
scarcely passed away".[63]

European arrival in the Americas
Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of
European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he
had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.

In 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what
they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean,
passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they
sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, conﬁrming
that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much
further south than Asia was known to.[64] On return to Europe, an account of
the voyage, called Mundus Novus ("New World"), was published under
Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,[65] although it seems that it had additions or
alterations by another writer.[66] Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus
Novus credited Vespucci with saying, "I have discovered a continent in those
southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than
our Europe, or Asia or Africa",[67] the ﬁrst known explicit identiﬁcation of part
of the Americas as a continent like the other three.
Within a few years, the name "New World" began appearing as a name for
South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around
1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to
Asia and showed South America as a separate land.[66]

In
1507
Martin
Waldseemüller
published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the
ﬁrst to show North and South America as separate from Asia and
surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map
explicitly showed for the ﬁrst time the Americas being east of Asia
and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the
Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the
accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller
noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa
and the fourth part, which he named "America" after Amerigo
Vespucci's ﬁrst name.[68] On the map, the word "America" was
placed on part of South America.

The word continent
From the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning
continuous or connected land[69] and translated from the Latin terra continens.[70] The noun was used to mean
"a connected or continuous tract of land" or mainland.[69] It was not applied only to very large areas of land—
in the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales
and in 1745 to Sumatra.[69] The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the
three "parts" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as
continent was used.[71]
While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand
geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into
separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that "A Continent is a
great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe,
Asia, Africa." In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia, "The world is ordinarily divided into two
grand continents: the old and the new." And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen deﬁned a continent as "a large
space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus
Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another."[72] However, the old idea of Europe,
Asia and Africa as "parts" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.

Beyond four continents
From the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two
parts of the world, making ﬁve parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th
century.[73]
Europeans discovered Australia in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th
century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or ﬁfth for those still
taking America as a single continent).[73] In 1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as "New Holland, an
immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent" and the Oxford
English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.[74] It was in the 1950s that the concept of
Oceania as a "great division" of the world was replaced by the concept of Australia as a continent.[75]

Antarctica was sighted in 1820 during the First Russian Antarctic
Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United
States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identiﬁed, although
a great "Antarctic" (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for
millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases
did so until after World War II.[76]
From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more
commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while
atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent.
However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as
one continent up until World War II.[77] From the 1950s, most U.S.
geographers divided the Americas into two continents.[77] With the addition
of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division
of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region
spanning an América as a single landmass, and there the conception of six
continents remains dominant, as it does in scattered other countries.

Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[78] In this model,
the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate
continents.

Geology
Geologists use the term continent in a diﬀerent manner from geographers. In geology a continent is deﬁned by
continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some
geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian "shield",
typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient
mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate
tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much
of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently
active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is
either a continental shelf and drop oﬀ to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent,
depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a
body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and
continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is
relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are "high and dry"; that is, many parts of the
continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the
subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.[79]
Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal "rafts"
that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins,
are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic
process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of
the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this
deﬁnition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions
could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the
rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield
areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton).
Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and
Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions
and the rest of Eurasia.
There are many microcontinents, or continental fragments,
that are built of continental crust but do not contain a
The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans
craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other
ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia,[80] which includes
New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the
northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean
Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust,
and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a
deﬁnition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the break-up of
Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[81][82] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The
British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent—only separated by
inland seas ﬂooding its margins.

Plate tectonics oﬀers yet another way of deﬁning continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the
uniﬁed Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding
India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya
mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the
connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North
American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate
boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian landmass. Geologists do
not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate
boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional deﬁnitions
("continental rocks," "plate boundaries") are used as appropriate.
The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional
formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or
Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years ago and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.[83][84]
The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or
all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight
continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia
(which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).

†† Claimed by Australia as part of Australian Antarctic Territory, but this claim is not widely recognised.
Some sources list the Kuma–Manych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border
between Europe and Asia.[86][87] This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc
(elevation 4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe – the lowest point would still be the shore of
the Caspian Sea.

subdivision if we adopted a strict deﬁnition of continents, ideally deﬁned as large landmasses separated by
water. Furthermore, we should consider "separated" only what is naturally separated, excluding therefore the
separations resulting from the artiﬁcially made Panama Canal (which separates North and South America)

Afro-Eurasia (or Eurafrasia), America, and Australia (not Oceania, which combines Australia with smaller
countries in the Paciﬁc Ocean which are separated by water), and Antarctica. An alternative four-continent
model, introduced at the beginning of the 20th centry, included Europe, Asia, Africa, and
America."worldometers
