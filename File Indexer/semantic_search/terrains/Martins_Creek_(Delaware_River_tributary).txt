Martins Creek (Delaware River
tributary)
Martins Creek is a 10.4-mile-long (16.7 km)[1]
tributary of the Delaware River in eastern
Pennsylvania in the United States.[2]
Martins Creek joins the Delaware River at the town of
Martins Creek.[2]
The source of the name was James Martin, early
settler to the town Martins Creek, who later was a
colonel during the Revolutionary War.

Minsi Lake in Northampton
County

East Fork
The East Fork rises to the south of Kittatinny Mountain in Upper Mount Bethel
Township, Northampton County. It is impounded to form Minsi Lake, the center of a
county park. The largest white perch caught in the state was caught here in 1991.
Below the lake, it ﬂows through a swamp and meets the West Fork just below North
Bangor.

West Fork
The West Fork rises in Hamilton Township, Monroe County, where Blue Mountain
and Kittatinny Mountain ridges are joined. Flowing northeast, and then swinging
east around the end of Blue Mountain, it joins the East Fork just below North Bangor.

Main stream
From the junction of the two forks, the main stream ﬂows south through Roseto and
Bangor, an area heavily marked with slate quarries. A former DL&W rail line, now
Norfolk Southern, follows it south from Bangor. It passes through Flicksville and

meets Greenwalk Creek just below Martins Creek Jct., where an abandoned DL&W
line once diverged and ran northwest to Pen Argyl. The creek valley now becomes
wide but steep, and increasingly narrow and twisty as it ﬂows further south and
meets Little Martins Creek. At the town of Martins Creek, the DL&W line connects to
the former PRR Martins Creek Branch (now also Norfolk Southern), and PA Route
611 crosses the creek and runs along it before continuing south along the Delaware
River. The creek passes the former Alpha Portland Cement plant, the major industry
in the town, and empties into the Delaware River.
