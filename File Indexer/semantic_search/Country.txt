Country
The term country refers
to a political state, nation,
or controlled territory. It is
often referred to as the
land of an individual's
birth,
residence,
or
citizenship.
A country may be an
independent
sovereign
state or part of a larger
state,[1] as a non-sovereign
or
formerly
sovereign
political
division,
a
physical territory with a
2019 map showing countries with full recognition and some UN
government,
or
a
non-member states; some disputed territories are not shown
geographic
region
associated with sets of
previously independent or diﬀerently associated people with distinct political
characteristics. It is not inherently sovereign.

Countries can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,[2] while
other times it can refer only to states.[3] For example, the CIA World Factbook uses
the word in its "Country name" ﬁeld to refer to "a wide variety of dependencies,
areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities in addition to the
traditional countries or independent states".[4][note 1]
The largest country in the world is Russia, while the most populous (https://www.wor
ldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) is China, followed by India
and the United States of America. The newest country is South Sudan.

Etymology and usage
The word country comes from Old French contrée, which derives from Vulgar Latin
(terra) contrata ("(land) lying opposite"; "(land) spread before"), derived from contra
("against, opposite"). It most likely entered the English language after the FrancoNorman invasion during the 11th century.
In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so
that one sense, associated with the indeﬁnite article – "a country" – through misuse
and subsequent conﬂation is now a synonym for state, or a former sovereign state, in
the sense of sovereign territory or "district, native land".[13] Areas much smaller than
a political state may be called by names such as the West Country in England, the
Black Country (a heavily industrialized part of England), "Constable Country" (a part
of East Anglia painted by John Constable), the "big country" (used in various contexts
of the American West), "coal country" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and
many other terms.[14]
The equivalent terms in French and other Romance languages (pays and variants)
have not carried the process of being identiﬁed with political sovereign states as far
as the English "country", instead derived from, pagus, which designated the territory
controlled by a medieval count, a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In
many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national
territory, as in the German Bundesländer, as well as a less formal term for a
sovereign state. France has very many "pays" that are oﬀicially recognized at some
level, and are either natural regions, like the Pays de Bray, or reﬂect old political or
economic entities, like the Pays de la Loire.
A version of "country" can be found in the modern French language as contrée,
based on the word cuntrée in Old French,[14] that is used similarly to the word "pays"
to deﬁne non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some
particular cases. The modern Italian contrada is a word with its meaning varying
locally, but usually meaning a ward or similar small division of a town, or a village or
hamlet in the countryside.

Sovereignty status
The term "country" can refer to a sovereign state. There is no universal agreement
on the number of "countries" in the world since a number of states have disputed
sovereignty status. By one application of the declarative theory of statehood and
constitutive theory of statehood, there are 206 sovereign states; of which 193 are
members of the United Nations, two have observer status at the UN (the Holy See
and Palestine), and 11 others are neither a member nor observer at the UN. The
latest proclaimed state is South Sudan since 2011.
The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are
possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas territories (such as
French Polynesia or the British Virgin Islands), with citizenry at times identical and
at times distinct from their own. Such territories, with the exception of distinct
dependent territories, are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of
countries, but may nonetheless be treated as a separate "country of origin" in
international trade, as Hong Kong is.[15][16][17]

A few states consist of a union of smaller polities which are considered countries:
The Kingdom of the Netherlands includes four separate countries: Netherlands,
Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten.
The United Kingdom includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The
Crown Dependencies, which are not part of the UK itself, are also sometimes
referred to as countries.
The Kingdom of Denmark includes three separate countries: Denmark, Faroe
Islands, and Greenland.

Country classiﬁcation
Several organizations seek to identify trends in order to produce country
classiﬁcations. Countries are often distinguished as developing countries or
developed countries.
The United Nations
The UN Department of Economic and Social Aﬀairs annually produces the World
Economic Situation and Prospects report that classiﬁed states as developed
countries, economies in transition, or developing countries. The report classiﬁes
country development based on per capita gross national income. Within the broad
categories, the United Nations identiﬁed subgroups based on geographical location
or ad hoc criteria. The UN outlines the geographical regions for developing
economies as Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and Latin America and the
Caribbean. The 2019 report recognizes only developed countries in North America,
Europe, and Asia and the Paciﬁc. The majority of economies in transition and
developing countries are found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.
The UN additionally recognizes multiple trends that impact the developmental status
of countries in the World Economic Situation and Prospects. The report highlights
fuel-exporting and fuel-importing countries, as well as small island developing states
and landlocked developing countries. It also identiﬁes heavily indebted poor
countries.[18]
The World Bank
The World Bank also classiﬁes countries based on GNI per capita. Using the World
Bank Atlas method, it classiﬁes countries as low-income economies, lower-middleincome economies, upper-middle-income economies, or high-income economies. For
the 2020 ﬁscal year, the World Bank deﬁnes low-income economies as countries with
a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less in 2018; lower middle-income economies as
countries with a GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; upper middle-income
economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; highincome economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $12,376 or more.[19]
It also identiﬁes regional trends. The World Bank deﬁnes its regions as East Asia and
Paciﬁc, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and
North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, the World
Bank distinguishes countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank.

The three categories include International Development Association (IDA) countries,
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries, and Blend
countries.
